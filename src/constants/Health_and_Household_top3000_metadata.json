            "Product Description",
            "The Zacurate Pro Series 500DL fingertip pulse oximeter is manufactured according to the CE and FDA standards set for pulse oximeter designed for sports enthusiasts, pilots or anyone who wants to obtain their SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation levels) and PR (Pulse Rate) on the go. The pulse oximeter LED display now faces the user so that the user can read it easily. We have also upgraded many internal hardware and software components of the pulse oximeter. For example: the pulse oximeter can now display SpO2 up to 100%! Taking a reading is easy, just clip it on to your finger and turn it on at the press of a button. The large LED display makes viewing the results a snap. Its small size makes it easy to carry around and a lanyard is also included for added convenience. Comes with 2 AAA batteries and a silicon cover to protect your pulse oximeter from dirt and damage. Zacurate is a registered trademark of USPTO. We will actively and aggressively pursue any parties who infringe on our intellectual property rights to the maximum extent allowed by the law. Beware of Imitation, Buy Original. Zacurate Pulse oximeter is designed in USA. This device is for Sports & Aviation use only and is not a medical device.  Note: Low blood perfusion can affect accuracy of your readings. Warm your hands and fingers before taking your measurements by rubbing your hands together. Remember your pulse oximeter is measuring your SpO2 and PR based on your blood flow. If the blood flow in your finger drops below a certain level, the pulse oximeter will not be able to function. It usually takes 10 seconds to get a reading. Some people though may require a longer time for the pulse oximeter to optimize its sensitivity. You may have to wait about 30 seconds for the readings to stabilize. Keep your hand still while taking a reading - any movement can cause the device to reset its' reading. Nail polish and fake fingernails may cause false readings. If possible, switch to an unpolished nail or consider another application site.",

Aptly named the \u201csunshine vitamin,\u201d D3 is naturally synthesized when bare skin is exposed to UVB sunlight. But studies show that most of us don\u2019t get enough from this source. The Mayo Clinic estimates that 25%-50% of the general population may be vitamin D deficient.* NatureWise Vitamin D3 5, 000 delivers a potent dose of the same biologically active form of vitamin D produced in the body from sunlight \u2014 without the risk of unprotected UVB exposure.* Live Healthy, Live HappyAt NatureWise, we believe that being healthy and happy is about caring for your whole self. It\u2019s about making wise choices that support you in feeling your best and living your fullest life. Our supplements are designed to support your body\u2019s natural wisdom and your own healthy choices to promote authentic well-being from the inside out."

Scale is placed on a hard, flat surface (tile, wood, etc.). If it is placed on something soft (such as carpet), it will not weigh accurately. 2. Keep your gravity in the center of the scale and your body stable while taking measurements. 3. Clear the scale: step on the scale until the display lights up, then step off until the scale shows \"0.0.\" Do this each time you are measuring your weight. 4. Try weighing first thing in the morning (after using the restroom) and with minimal clothing to prevent deviation or skewed readings. 5. This scale was designed for measuring weights of at least 11 lb. For lighter objects, we suggest an Etekcity kitchen scale. 6.Package Information: 1 x Etekcity Body weight scale, 1 x QSG, 3 x 1.5V AAA batteries."

            "The 2-pack of BlenderBottle Classic 28-Ounce Shaker Cups makes it easy to maintain proper nutrition and hydration on-the-go. While one dishwasher-safe bottle is getting clean, there\u2019s another on hand for mixing protein shakes, smoothies, fiber drinks, and meal replacements. Featuring a patented mixing system, the 316 surgical-grade stainless steel BlenderBall wire whisk (found only in BlenderBottle brand shaker cups) moves freely inside the bottle to smooth out drink mixes and meal ingredients. It\u2019s also a handy kitchen tool for mixing pancake batter, scrambled eggs, and salad dressings. The wide mouth makes it easy to add scoops of powdered mixes, meal ingredients, and liquids, and embossed markings show both ounces and milliliters for easy measuring anywhere (note that markings on the 28-ounce capacity shaker cup only go up to 20 ounces). Bottle contents and liquids are securely contained thanks to a tightly threaded screw-on lid that creates a leakproof seal, and a flip cap that snaps securely shut for shaking and transportation. The convenient loop top makes it easy to carry the bottle and offers a place to attach car keys while at the gym. The BlenderBottle Classic 28-Ounce Shaker Bottle can also be used as a water bottle; the ball can be left inside, as it will never rust, chip, or peel. Includes two, 28-ounce BlenderBottles.

From the #1 doctor recommended bandage brand, Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages help protect against dirt & germs that may cause infection for up to 24 hours, making them a great addition to a first aid kit or wound care supplies.

            "Our clothes are in constant contact with bacteria throughout our day-to-day activities, for example through contact with contaminated surfaces, other people and our own bodies. Bacteria can spread from one fabric to another in the laundry basket, from the washing-machine drum to the next load. Some these bacteria can survive a wash cycle and can cause potential infection risk with pathogenic bacteria. When it comes to certain laundry loads such as children's clothes or sportswear, you want your detergent to eliminate bacteria that can cause illnesses and create lingering bad smells. But detergents alone don't actually kill all bacteria. Introducing Lysol Laundry Sanitizer, an additive specially designed to kill 99.9% of bacteria left behind. Simply add Lysol Laundry Sanitizer to your rinse cycle. It does not contain any bleach and even works in cold water so is safe to use on most fabrics including whites, colors and darks."

            "Product Description",
            "The Innovo Deluxe Fingertip pulse oximeter shows your measured SpO2 and Pulse Rate on a high quality OLED screen (with six multidirectional display choices) and come with two critically acclaimed features, the Plethysmograph and Perfusion Index (PI), that will improve the reliability of the readings dramatically. Each wave corresponds to a heartbeat and the amplitude to the amount of blood detected in your blood vessels. When the height of the wave amplitude no longer fluctuates (as shown like the figure above), this means that the pulse oximeter is now optimized and you may now take the readings. Meanwhile, the PI conveniently informs you of the strength of your pulse. If the PI value is less than 0.2%, this means that your hands are too cold or improperly positioned in the pulse oximeter. Simply warm your finger and reposition it so that it is right under the LED lights. No more second guessing if the readings are reliable or why the pulse oximeter is not giving a reading. Using a vastly improved sensor, the Innovo deluxe pulse oximeter can also now correct for small movements, allowing more versatile usage. Comes with a lanyard and 2 AAA batteries so that you can use the pulse oximeter right out of the box. The oximeter might not work on kids or adults with small fingers. Innovo is a registered trademark of USPTO. We will actively and aggressively pursue any parties who infringe on our intellectual property rights to the maximum extent allowed by the law. Beware of Imitation, Buy Original. Innovo Pulse Oximeter is designed in USA.",

            "Compare to Prilosec OTC. Stop the painful burning sensation of frequent heartburn before it begins with Amazon Basic Care Omeprazole Delayed Release Tablets 20 mg. Omeprazole is the #1 Active Ingredient for Frequent Heartburn (based on iRi sales volume among PPI products sold in the United States, for the 52 weeks ending 01/01/23). When used as directed for 14 days, Omeprazole prevents heartburn that is frequent in nature and provides long-lasting, 24-hour relief so you can enjoy every moment with family and friends. This heartburn medicine may take one to four days for full effect, although some people get complete relief of symptoms within 24 hours. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs), like Omeprazole, work differently from antacid tablets and other acid reducer pills. These heartburn relief treatments only neutralize the stomach acid and provide shorter relief (less than 24 hours). Omeprazole stops acid production at the source, preventing the acid that causes heartburn symptoms for relief that lasts all day and night. This heartburn medicine is a 14-day course of treatment that should be taken once every 24 hours for 14 days to treat frequent heartburn flare-ups. For adults 18 years and older suffering from frequent heartburn that occurs two or more days a week."

            "Did you know your contact solution can make a difference in the comfort of your contacts? From the eye care experts at Bausch + Lomb, introducing NEW Biotrue Hydration Plus Multi-Purpose Solution. It keeps MORE MOISTURE on your contacts (for 12 hours compared to Biotrue Multi-Purpose Solution, based on a laboratory study). Biotrue Hydration Plus contact lens solution provides exceptional cleaning. It removes dirt and protein build-up for clean, clear lenses. Biotrue Hydration Plus provides up to 20 hours of moisture (based on a laboratory study). It also offers all day comfort. Biotrue Hydration Plus is now enhanced to keep EVEN MORE MOISTURE on your contacts (for 12 hours compared to Biotrue Multi-Purpose Solution, based on a laboratory study). It contains naturally inspired ingredients, inspired by the biology of the eye: it\u2019s enhanced with 25% more hyaluronan (a.k.a. HA, a moisturizer found naturally in tears) vs. Biotrue Multi-Purpose Solution; and is the only contact solution to contain an antioxidant (protects HA against free radicals) as well as potassium (an electrolyte found naturally in tears). Biotrue Hydration Plus also matches the pH of healthy tears to help make contacts comfortable when you put them in. BIO.0005.USA.22."

            "The BlenderBottle Pro Series Shaker Bottles are built off the tried-and-true design of the iconic BlenderBottle Classic, with the addition of pro-grade features that make it easy to maintain proper nutrition and hydration on-the-go. Manufactured from BPA and phthalate-free Eastman Tritan, a durable and odor-free plastic that guards against lingering flavors, it keeps today\u2019s smoothie from tasting like last week\u2019s protein shake. Bottle contents and liquids are securely contained by a tightly threaded screw-on lid that creates a leakproof seal, and an ergonomic flip cap that snaps securely shut for shaking and transportation (fits in most cupholders). A SpoutGuard makes it possible to open the flip top without touching the drinking spout. The patented mixing system\u2014with a 316 surgical-grade stainless steel BlenderBall wire whisk that moves inside the bottle to smooth out mixes\u2014makes it ideal for protein shakes, smoothies, fiber drinks, and meal replacements. A wide mouth makes it easy to add ingredients, and a rounded base ensures thorough mixing and easy cleanup. Embossed markings show both ounces and milliliters for easy measuring anywhere. The BlenderBottle Pro Series Shaker Bottle can also be used as a water bottle. Available in three sizes: 24-Ounce (measurements go to 16 ounces), 28-Ounce (measurements go to 22 ounces); 32-Ounce (measurements go to 26 ounces). Dishwasher safe.."

            "Excessive earwax build-up can lead to ear discomfort and reduced hearing, which can affect your day-to-day life. Debrox Earwax Removal Drops are a safe and inexpensive in-home solution. Debrox's gentle, non-irritating microfoam cleansing action goes to work to soften and loosen earwax. When drops are placed in the ear, oxygen is released. This release allows Debrox to foam on contact as it gently softens and loosens earwax. Once broken down, earwax is able to drain from the ear and ears are relieved of built-up earwax so you can return back to daily life without muffled hearing caused by excess earwax. Trust Debrox to help keep your ears \u2013 and hearing \u2013 clear. Also available in a convenient kit featuring a soft rubber bulbs syringe to rinse your ear after using Debrox Earwax Removal Drops. Debrox is the No.1 doctor- and pharmacist-recommended brand for earwax removal. IQVIA Claim Substantiation Validation Statement, 12/1/18 - 11/30/19; Pharmacy Times 2019 Annual Pharmacists Survey."

Modern medicine has begun to recognize its importance as well \u2014 as indicated by the over 3000 studies dealing with turmeric that have been published within the last 25 years. Turmeric continues to garner attention from the health community, thanks to its antioxidant properties and potential to promote a healthy inflammatory response.*",

NatureWise Organic Curcumin additionally includes organic ginger, a polyphenol with complementary antioxidant properties. The combined support of curcumin and ginger may assist in several protective functions in the GI tract and in the liver, and in several studies curcumin has demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity.*",
            "Derived from Organic Turmeric",

            "Despite their extraordinary potential, many herbs can have limited benefits due to poor absorption. Our formula includes organic ginger and BioPerine black pepper extract to improve the bioavailability and benefits of curcumin. BioPerine has been clinically shown to increase absorption by as much as 4x, making NatureWise Organic Curcumin more effective than other formulas that do not contain clinically proven bioenhancers.*"

            "Excessive earwax build-up can lead to ear discomfort and reduced hearing, which can affect your day-to-day life. Debrox Earwax Removal Drops are a safe and inexpensive in-home solution. Debrox's gentle, non-irritating microfoam cleansing action goes to work to soften and loosen earwax. When drops are placed in the ear, oxygen is released. This release allows Debrox to foam on contact as it gently softens and loosens earwax. Once broken down, earwax is able to drain from the ear and ears are relieved of built-up earwax so you can return back to daily life without muffled hearing caused by excess earwax. Trust Debrox to help keep your ears \u2013 and hearing \u2013 clear. Also available in a convenient kit featuring a soft rubber bulbs syringe to rinse your ear after using Debrox Earwax Removal Drops. Debrox is the No.1 doctor- and pharmacist-recommended brand for earwax removal. IQVIA Claim Substantiation Validation Statement, 12/1/18 - 11/30/19; Pharmacy Times 2019 Annual Pharmacists Survey."

            "Mixture Packets Box Contains: 100 Regular Premixed Packets of pH Balanced Sodium Chloride & Sodium Bicarbonate Mixture (USP Grade, Natural Ingredients, Isotonic, Preservative Free & Iodine Free) Educational Brochure Instructions in English, Spanish or French What is the difference between Hypertonic (green) and Isotonic (blue) packets? This Green colored packet will make a Hypertonic (higher concentration) solution when mixed with 8 oz. (240 ml.) of water. It can also make an isotonic solution, equivalent to our regular blue colored packet, if mixed with 16 oz. (480 ml.) of water. Our regular product, the blue colored packet, makes an isotonic solution in 8 oz. (240 ml.) of water (using our SINUS RINSE bottle or other measuring devices). It is strongly recommended to use this Green packet only under the advice of your physician or using your judgment. A few research reports, plus feedback from some physicians and customers have reported additional benefits from using a hypertonic solution. If you experience any intolerable burning or stinging, please discontinue the use of the hypertonic solution. In my opinion, apart from transient, mild burning, it will not cause any permanent damage with a few uses. With time, you will be able to judge as far as what concentration of saline works best for you. What is the difference between the Pediatric Kit and the regular kit? NeilMed s Pediatric Sinus Rinse bottle has a volume capacity of 4 oz. (120 ml.), and an aperture (opening) on top of the cap of 3/32 in. (2.5 mm). Our Regular Sinus Rinse bottle has a volume capacity of 8 oz. (240 ml.) and an aperture (opening) on top of the cap of 3/16 in. (4.5 mm). Both systems are designed to give the same concentration of solution. Children or adults who feel that the volume of the regular 8 oz. (240 ml.) bottle with the 3/16 in. (4.5 mm) cap is too large, should consider trying the pediatric kit. The therapeutic benefits will be identical. Please do not use our regular blue colored. Suggested age - 10 years and up."

            "Mixture Packets Box Contains: 100 Regular Premixed Packets of pH Balanced Sodium Chloride & Sodium Bicarbonate Mixture (USP Grade, Natural Ingredients, Isotonic, Preservative Free & Iodine Free) Educational Brochure Instructions in English, Spanish or French What is the difference between Hypertonic (green) and Isotonic (blue) packets? This Green colored packet will make a Hypertonic (higher concentration) solution when mixed with 8 oz. (240 ml.) of water. It can also make an isotonic solution, equivalent to our regular blue colored packet, if mixed with 16 oz. (480 ml.) of water. Our regular product, the blue colored packet, makes an isotonic solution in 8 oz. (240 ml.) of water (using our SINUS RINSE bottle or other measuring devices). It is strongly recommended to use this Green packet only under the advice of your physician or using your judgment. A few research reports, plus feedback from some physicians and customers have reported additional benefits from using a hypertonic solution. If you experience any intolerable burning or stinging, please discontinue the use of the hypertonic solution. In my opinion, apart from transient, mild burning, it will not cause any permanent damage with a few uses. With time, you will be able to judge as far as what concentration of saline works best for you. What is the difference between the Pediatric Kit and the regular kit? NeilMed s Pediatric Sinus Rinse bottle has a volume capacity of 4 oz. (120 ml.), and an aperture (opening) on top of the cap of 3/32 in. (2.5 mm). Our Regular Sinus Rinse bottle has a volume capacity of 8 oz. (240 ml.) and an aperture (opening) on top of the cap of 3/16 in. (4.5 mm). Both systems are designed to give the same concentration of solution. Children or adults who feel that the volume of the regular 8 oz. (240 ml.) bottle with the 3/16 in. (4.5 mm) cap is too large, should consider trying the pediatric kit. The therapeutic benefits will be identical. Please do not use our regular blue colored. Suggested age - 10 years and up."

Do not touch, lift or move a burning candle. Wait until the wax has cooled and hardened before touching a candle. For optimal performance, keep burning candles away from drafts, vents and air currents. Stop using your Glade Jar Candle when 1/4 inch of wax remains. Be sure the candle jar is placed on a stable, heat-resistant surface. Never place flammable materials near a candle. Never burn candles unattended. Do not burn candles where they can be knocked over by children, pets or anyone else."

            "MiraLAX is a polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350) laxative powder made for providing gentle constipation relief. Unlike some laxatives which stimulate the nerves, MiraLAX is a non stimulant osmotic laxative, working naturally with the water in your body to hydrate, soften, and ease stool through the colon gently. Since going on the market in 2007, MiraLAX has been the #1 Physician Recommended OTC brand of laxative. It relieves occasional constipation without causing harsh side effects like cramping, bloating, sudden urgency, and gas. MiraLAX is a gentle laxative designed to relieve occasional constipation and presents no risk of product dependence. Constipation can be caused by lifestyle factors such as stress, diet, travel, medications, and lack of exercise. It can be defined by fewer than normal bowel movements, difficulty passing stool and abdominal bloating. To use, fill bottle cap to the indicated line (white section in cap) and pour into 4 to 8 ounces of hot or cold beverage including but not limited to coffee, tea, juice, milk and more. Mix until the powder is fully dissolved, then drink. Plus, MiraLAX has no added taste or grit. MiraLAX generally produces a bowel movement in 1-3 days."

            "From the Manufacturer",
            "Nature Made's Natural Vitamin E is recommended as part of a daily regimen for heart health, women's and men's health, longevity, prenatal care, memory, and fitness. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that fights against damaging natural substances known as free radicals. It is incorporated into the fat-based tissues of the body, such as the heart, fat-carrier molecules like LDL (\"bad\" cholesterol), and our cell membranes, where it acts to stabilize these structures and protect them from free radical attack. Vitamin E also protects our cells from compounds such as lead, mercury, and other heavy metals. Vitamin E complements vitamin C in its function; therefore, it's recommended to take the two vitamins together. There are several natural compounds, called tocopherols, that demonstrate vitamin E activity, but the natural form of vitamin E (d-Alpha Tocopherol) is the most common and potent form, and is best absorbed by the body. This natural vitamin E is the most active compound in terms of antioxidant activity.",

            "Influence",
            ":In his final letter to Theo, Vincent admitted that as he did not have any children, he viewed his paintings as his progeny. Reflecting on this, the historian Simon Schama concluded that he \"did have a child of course, Expressionism, and many, many heirs.\" Schama mentioned a wide number of artists who have adapted elements of Van Gogh's style, including Willem de Kooning, Howard Hodgkin and Jackson Pollock.The French Fauves, including Henri Matisse, extended both his use of color and freedom in applying it,as did German Expressionists in the Die Br\u00a8\u00b9cke group. Abstract Expressionism of the 1940s and 1950s' is seen as in part inspired from Van Gogh's broad, gestural brush strokes."

WaterWipes was created by a father, inspired by a daughter. Our founder developed WaterWipes after his newborn suffered from bad diaper rash, and he realized skin this pure needs care that\u2019s just as pure.

Menstrual cups have existed since the 1930s when women were searching for an alternative to the choices of the time. Yet, its breakthrough into the feminine hygiene industry is much more recent.Many women feel uneasy about changing their menstrual care routine. Years of dealing with the sights and odors of disposable tampons and pads cause the familiar reaction: \u201cick!\u201d. The DivaCup empowers women to connect with their bodies and menstrual cycles like never before. Perfect for all activities (on air, land or sea), its easy care and use make for a better period experience. Wear The DivaCup for up to 12 hours without leaks or worry."

        "description": [
            "Debrox Earwax Removal Kit includes a soft rubber bulb syringe to rinse your ear after using Debrox Earwax Removal Drops. Excessive earwax build-up can lead to ear discomfort and reduced hearing, which can affect your day-to-day life. Debrox Earwax Removal Drops are a safe and inexpensive in-home solution. Debrox's gentle, non-irritating microfoam cleansing action goes to work to soften and loosen earwax. When drops are placed in the ear, oxygen is released. This release allows Debrox to foam on contact as it gently softens and loosens earwax. Once broken down, earwax is able to drain from the ear and ears are relieved of built-up earwax so you can return back to daily life without muffled hearing caused by excess earwax. Trust Debrox to help keep your ears \u2013 and hearing \u2013 clear. Debrox is the #1 doctor & pharmacist recommended brand for earwax removal*. *IQVIA Claim Substantiation Validation Statement, 12/1/18 - 11/30/19; Pharmacy Times 2019 Annual Pharmacists Survey"

            "Vitron-C is a high potency iron supplement formulated with Vitamin C to help your body better absorb iron. The use of an iron pill daily may boost energy by helping to fight fatigue in users with low iron levels* or iron-deficiency anemia. Vitron-C iron supplements contain carbonyl iron which provides gradual and gentle iron absorption and helps minimize constipation*. The added Vitamin C improves iron absorption*. Vitron-C iron with Vitamin C supplement is dye free, gluten free and vegan. Without enough iron, your body can't make enough hemoglobin, a substance that helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Hemoglobin also helps our muscles store and use oxygen. Iron deficiency can affect many body functions. It can delay growth in children, stand in the way of our ability to do work as adults, cause problems during pregnancy and it can even cause heart problems, such as a rapid or irregular heartbeat. If your doctor advises that you have iron deficiency, talk to them about Vitron-C iron supplements. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

            "Debrox Earwax Removal Kit includes a soft rubber bulb syringe to rinse your ear after using Debrox Earwax Removal Drops. Excessive earwax build-up can lead to ear discomfort and reduced hearing, which can affect your day-to-day life. Debrox Earwax Removal Drops are a safe and inexpensive in-home solution. Debrox's gentle, non-irritating microfoam cleansing action goes to work to soften and loosen earwax. When drops are placed in the ear, oxygen is released. This release allows Debrox to foam on contact as it gently softens and loosens earwax. Once broken down, earwax is able to drain from the ear and ears are relieved of built-up earwax so you can return back to daily life without muffled hearing caused by excess earwax. Trust Debrox to help keep your ears \u2013 and hearing \u2013 clear. Debrox is the #1 doctor & pharmacist recommended brand for earwax removal*. *IQVIA Claim Substantiation Validation Statement, 12/1/18 - 11/30/19; Pharmacy Times 2019 Annual Pharmacists Survey"

            "Debrox Earwax Removal Kit includes a soft rubber bulb syringe to rinse your ear after using Debrox Earwax Removal Drops. Excessive earwax build-up can lead to ear discomfort and reduced hearing, which can affect your day-to-day life. Debrox Earwax Removal Drops are a safe and inexpensive in-home solution. Debrox's gentle, non-irritating microfoam cleansing action goes to work to soften and loosen earwax. When drops are placed in the ear, oxygen is released. This release allows Debrox to foam on contact as it gently softens and loosens earwax. Once broken down, earwax is able to drain from the ear and ears are relieved of built-up earwax so you can return back to daily life without muffled hearing caused by excess earwax. Trust Debrox to help keep your ears \u2013 and hearing \u2013 clear. Debrox is the #1 doctor & pharmacist recommended brand for earwax removal*. *IQVIA Claim Substantiation Validation Statement, 12/1/18 - 11/30/19; Pharmacy Times 2019 Annual Pharmacists Survey"

            "It is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta that nearly 50% of the population of the United States lives with gum disease in some form. Whether you\u2019re noticing sensitive teeth, bleeding gums, or have been diagnosed with gingivitis, TheraBreath Healthy Gums Oral Rinse is an effective solution. Healthy Gums Oral Rinse is a safe and effective treatment to fight bacteria and common symptoms of gum disease, which can also be related to diabetes. Dr. Katz\u2019s Healthy Gums Oral Rinse is periodontist-formulated to help people living with gum disease. TheraBreath Healthy Gums Oral Rinse contains cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), an ingredient clinically proven to kill germs linked to gum disease and other periodontal problems, and adds a sweetener, xylitol (but NO saccharin), to neutralize the decay process. CPC attacks the bacteria that lead to gingivitis, which is early stage gum disease that produces red, swollen, and even bleeding gums. It also helps to fight periodontitis, a later stage gum disease. Periodontitis can cause gums to pull away from the teeth, bone loss, and potentially even tooth loss. This 24-hour oral rinse is packed with Dr. Katz\u2019s patented oxygenating compounds and added zinc compounds to fight bad breath germs with no mixing needed. This product is alcohol-free, which reduces irritation and the occurrence of inflamed and sensitive gums, it contains no artificial colors or flavors, and it is certified vegan, kosher, and gluten-free. TheraBreath Healthy Gums 24-hour Oral Rinse formula is also exceptional for treating gum-related problems associated with menopause, pregnancy, and other medical conditions. The non-acidic formula of Healthy Gums Oral Rinse has a gentle Clean Mint flavor without added saccharin. This product is sold as a pack of six 3-ounce bottles. As with all our products, TheraBreath Healthy Gums Oral Rinse is guaranteed to work to your satisfaction or your money back!"

            "SinuCleanse Nasal Wash products were developed by a leading Ear Nose & Throat Physician as an all-natural way to safely & effectively relieve nasal congestion and sinus symptoms without the worry of harmful side-effects or drug interactions. Studies suggest that Nasal Washing regularly may reduce the duration and frequency of cold & flu symptoms and promote long term nasal health. Nasal Washing moisturizes dry nasal passages and aids in the removal of mucus and irritants such as dust particles, pollen, and other debris, keeping nasal passages clear and allowing you to breathe easier. The SinuCleanse All-Natural Pharmaceutical Grade Pre-Mixed Saline Packets are made in the USA in an FDA Registered Drug Facility. Each packet contains all-natural, preservative free, ultra-fine salt granules which when mixed with water dissolve instantly to form a buffered salt water solution that will not sting or burn, making nasal washing easy and comfortable. They may be used in most other Nasal Wash Systems and can be used to form an Isotonic or Hypertonic Solution. (See instruction sheet inside box for more information)."

            "Say goodbye to discomfort from bladder leaks and hello to Poise Postpartum Incontinence Pads in 6 Drop Ultimate Absorbency and Long Length, a pad that is designed for your comfort and protection. Poise incontinence pads for women are made specifically for bladder leaks, unlike period pads, which are meant for menstrual needs. In fact, Poise pads keep you 10x drier compared to the leading period pad. Poise pads absorb bladder leaks, lock away wetness, and neutralize odors, helping you feel clean and fresh throughout the day. Our pads are also made with breathable materials that help eliminate dampness, so you feel clean and fresh too! Poise bladder control pads are discreet and fit securely in your underwear. Poise incontinence pads are available in light, moderate, maximum, ultra, and overnight absorbencies. For lighter absorbent needs, check out Poise Daily Liners. Shop for Poise discreetly by having it shipped directly to your door or pick up curbside. Poise adult incontinence products are HSA/FSA-eligible in the U.S. *Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back: Online access required. Limit 1 per household. Original receipt/UPC required. Restrictions apply. See Poise website for details."

Mr. Blaisdell watched a friend struggle awkwardly to use a cumbersome, Austrian-made lighter. In late 1932 Mr. Blaisdell decided to reconstruct the Austrian lighter. He fabricated a small rectangular case and attached a lid with a hinge. He preserved the chimney design which protected the flame. The result was an attractive lighter that was easily operated with one hand. The name \u201cZippo\u201d was created by Mr Blaisdell.",
            "GUARANTEE:",
            "In a world where most products are simply disposable or available with limited warranties, the Zippo pocket lighter remains backed by its famous lifetime guarantee. In more than 85 years, no one has ever spent a cent on the mechanical repair of a Zippo pocket lighter regardless of the lighter\u2019s age or condition. The Zippo pocket lighter is ingrained in American culture and is a global icon of durability and reliability."
