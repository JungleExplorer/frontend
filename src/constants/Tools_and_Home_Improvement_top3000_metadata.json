            "Get cleaner*, great-tasting water for longer with the Brita Elite Pitcher Replacement Filters which remove 99% of Lead* in your water and reduces 30 contaminants. This long-lasting water filter is made with Advanced Carbon Core Technology to reduce more than 3x the contaminants of standard Brita filters. The Brita Elite replacement filter reduces Lead, Asbestos, Mercury, Benzene, Cadmium, and more*. Change the Brita Elite filter every 120 gallons, about every 6 months for best performance**. The pull top cap makes insertion and removal easy. With activated carbon to reduce chlorine taste and odor, this water filter delivers great-tasting water and maintains a healthy level of fluoride (applies to fluoridated municipal tap water). The fibrous matrix in the filter holds active ingredients in place so no black flecks appear in your water. One Brita Elite filter can replace up to 900 16.9 oz single-use plastic bottles and reduces more contaminants vs. PUR and ZeroWater (based on NSF/WQA certifications for Brita OB06, PUR PPF951K, and ZeroWater ZF-201 pitcher filters as of 8/17/21). *Cleaner vs. tap water. Healthier based on health contaminant reduction per WQA certifications. Substances reduced may not be in all users water. See certifications. Performance Data Sheet available on Brita.com. **Approximate timing based on 120 gallon (454 litres) lter life and average family usage of 11 glasses per day. ^Versus standard 16.9 oz bottled water. No single-use plastic bottle waste."

            "Aerostar 12x12x1 MERV 8 Pleated Air Filters (Actual Size: 11 3/4\" x 11 3/4\" x 3/4\") - 6 Pack. MERV 8 filters are comparable to MPR 600 and FPR 5. Designed for superior filtration efficiency, these filters are made with electrostatically charged synthetic material that draws and captures allergens between 0.3 - 1.0 microns, including lint, dust mites, spores, and pollen. Aerostar filters are a simple and cost effective step towards a healthier home environment, free of airborne allergens and particles that can trigger various allergy and asthma symptoms. They also improve the efficiency of your HVAC unit and therefore reduce maintenance and utility costs, by removing dirt and reducing strain on the motor. For best results, change the filter every 60 to 90 days but increase frequency to 30 days during peak summer and winter months when your unit is working the hardest. Compatible with furnaces and AC units."

        "description": [
            "The Kidde Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Detector with Voice Alerts, Battery Powered, Combination Smoke & CO Alarm, model KN-COSM-BA, provides two fire safety detectors in one unit through the use of ionization sensing technology that senses invisible fire particles, while an electrochemical sensor detects carbon monoxide. When a smoke, fire, or carbon monoxide event occurs, the Kidde fire alarm warns with an 85-decibel alarm sound, flashing LEDs, and voice alerts. For smoke detection, the alarm will sound with the announcement, \"Fire! Fire!\" and a red LED will flash in unison with the voice alarm. For carbon monoxide detection, the alarm will sound with the announcement \"Warning! Carbon Monoxide!\". In the event of a low battery, the detector will announce, \"Low Battery!\" The Kidde combination smoke and carbon monoxide alarm is powered by 2-AA batteries, which provide coverage during a power failure. A convenient pop-up, front-door battery compartment allows for quick installation or replacement of a battery without having to disconnect the entire unit from the ceiling. In the case of nuisance or false alarm, the Smart Hush button silences the unit for approximately 8 minutes, which is helpful when this smoke detector carbon monoxide detector combo sounds from things like routine cooking or shower steam. When installed, the green LED on the alarm will flash every 60 seconds in standby condition, letting you know that the unit has power & is operating correctly. Install a carbon monoxide smoke detector combo on every level of your home and near bedrooms to help keep your family safe. UL Certified with a 10-year limited manufacturers' warranty. Meets requirements of UL 2034, UL217, NFPA72, (chapter 11 2002 edition) The State of California Fire Marshal, NFPA101 (One and two family dwellings) Federal Housing Authority (FHA), Housing and Urban Development (HUD)."

Designed for superior filtration efficiency, these filters are made with electrostatically charged synthetic material that draws and captures allergens between 0.3 - 1.0 microns, including lint, dust mites, mold spores, pollen, pet dander, fine dust, smoke, viruses, and bacteria. Aerostar filters are a simple and cost effective step towards a healthier home environment, free of airborne allergens and particles that can trigger various allergy and asthma symptoms. They also improve the efficiency of your HVAC unit and therefore reduce maintenance and utility costs, by removing dirt and reducing strain on the motor. For best results, change the filter every 60 to 90 days but increase frequency to 30 days during peak summer and winter months when your unit is working the hardest. Compatible with furnaces and AC units."

            "Product Description",
            "The First Alert SCO5CN Combination Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm features dual sensors to detect both smoke and carbon monoxide in a single device. A photoelectric sensor detects the smoke most often produced by smoldering fires, and minimizes false alarms from cooking smoke or shower steam. Additionally, the advanced electrochemical CO sensor detects carbon monoxide leaks from multiple sources, such as faulty fuel burning appliances, blocked chimneys, and generators running inside or too close to homes. A loud, 85 decibel siren alerts you to the threat; unique alarm sounds and indicator lights on its face distinguish a smoke warning from a carbon monoxide warning. This carbon monoxide and smoke detector is battery operated, so you don't need an electrician for installation. Requiring just two AA batteries and featuring an easy access battery compartment for quick changes, this smoke and carbon monoxide detector has a single button that allows you to silence a false alarm or test the unit.",
            "Amazon.com",
            "Carbon monoxide (CO) is the leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in America, yet many people don't know they are suffering from CO poisoning until its too late. Since symptoms of CO poisoning are like the flu, you might not even know you're in danger at first. That's why a carbon monoxide alarm is an excellent way to protect your family. It can detect the CO you can't see, smell or taste in the air.",
            "The First Alert SCO5CN carbon monoxide and smoke alarm uses an electrochemical carbon monoxide sensor-the most accurate technology available. The alarm uses photoelectric smoke sensing technology which is environmentally friendlier and which reduces nuisance alarms, making it ideal for cooking areas. It is also great for sensing slow smoldering fires quickly. The permanent sensors last the lifetime of the alarm. The test/silence button both silences a non-threatening alarm or low battery warning and allows you to test the unit's functionality. A low battery signal alerts you to replace the battery and end-of-life alarm of three chirps alerts you to replace the unit. Two AA batteries are included. 5-year limited warranty. UL listed. Not available for sale in Massachusetts.",

Designed for superior filtration efficiency, these filters are made with electrostatically charged synthetic material that draws and captures allergens between 0.3 - 1.0 microns, including lint, dust mites, spores, pollen, pet dander, fine dust, and smoke. Aerostar filters are a simple and cost effective step towards a healthier home environment, free of airborne allergens and particles that can trigger various allergy and asthma symptoms. They also improve the efficiency of your HVAC unit and therefore reduce maintenance and utility costs, by removing dirt and reducing strain on the motor. For best results, change the filter every 60 to 90 days but increase frequency to 30 days during peak summer and winter months when your unit is working the hardest. Compatible with furnaces and AC units."

            "The Kidde Carbon Monoxide Detector, Plug In Wall with AA Battery Backup, Test-Hush Button uses electrochemical sensor technology to detect poisonous CO gas in your home and alert you by sounding an 85-decibel alarm. Setup is easy as the Kidde carbon monoxide alarm plugs into a standard, 120V AC power outlet in your home, while two AA alkaline batteries (included) work as a backup in the event of a power failure. When carbon monoxide is detected, the digital display shows the level of carbon monoxide the alarm is sensing and updates every 15 seconds. Peak Level Memory records the last time carbon monoxide was detected or when the unit was tested. The Smart-Hush button silences the unit for approximately 8 minutes, which is helpful when this smoke detector carbon monoxide detector combo sounds from things like routine cooking or shower steam. Install a carbon monoxide smoke detector combo on every level of your home and near bedrooms to help keep your family safe. UL Certified with a 10-year limited manufacturer's warranty. Meets requirements of UL 2034, UL217, NFPA72, (chapter 11 2002 edition) The State of California Fire Marshal, NFPA101 (One and two family dwellings) Federal Housing Authority (FHA), Housing and Urban Development (HUD)."

            "The 3D mitre angle is made of high-quality plastic and has a wide range of uses thanks to its centimetre and angular scales. This marking tool allows you to easily take measurements and transfer them onto beams, pipes and three-dimensional workpieces. Its rectangular geometry allows you to make precise markings around corners ideal for accurately transferring mitre angles onto two sides of a workpiece. With limit stops at 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 angles and a scale for free angles between 090\u00b0, you will be prepared for anything. The 3D mitre angle provides you with a marking gauge when marking parallel lines. It is also equipped with a drill gauge, for quickly determining the diameter of a drill bit."

            "While home tap water may look clean, lead and other contaminants can get into your water through leaching lead service lines or from lead contained in household plumbing. For cleaner water, remember to change your PUR faucet water filter.\u023d This easy-to-change PUR PLUS faucet mount water filter fits in all PUR faucet filtration systems. Each replacement water filter provides 100 gallons of filtered water or lasts up to 3 months of typical use.  PUR PLUS faucet water filter replacements are NSF and WQA certified to reduce 70 contaminants including lead.\u023d Plus, PUR PLUS Mineral Core technology filters water over natural minerals for great taste.  A compatible filter does not mean comparable! PUR faucet filtration system filter replacements are certified to reduce 10x more contaminants than Brita\u2019s leading pitcher filter.*\u023d Be cautious of 'off-brand' filters. They are not tested or certified to filter the same as PUR filters. PUR filters are the only filters certified to reduce contaminants when used with PUR systems.\u023d  PUR is the #1 selling brand in faucet filtration**. PUR has been developing innovative technologies for superior water filtration for over 30 years. We believe life deserves PUR water.  Disclaimers:  *Versus best-selling Brita\u00ae pitcher filter OB03. Brita\u00ae is a trademark of Brita LP.  **Based on Nielsen sales data for the 52 weeks ending 08/28/21.  \u023d PUR does not filter microbes."

            "Product Description",
            "The Kidde Carbon Monoxide Detector, Battery Powered CO Alarm with LEDs, Test-Reset Button, Low Battery Indicator, Portable, model 9CO5LP2, is a carbon monoxide detector that uses electrochemical sensor technology to detect carbon monoxide. The CO detector is powered by 2-AA alkaline batteries located in the back of the unit, providing easy installation & no wiring, plus coverage during a power failure. The alarm is conveniently designed and portable enough for travel - simply install it on a wall or place it on a tabletop. When carbon monoxide is detected, an 85-decibel alarm will sound & a red LED will flash. A green LED indicates that the alarm is receiving power. The test-hush button allows you to test the battery operations as well as temporarily silence the low battery chirp warning. Install a smoke detector & carbon monoxide detector on every level of your home and near bedrooms to help keep your family safe from fire & poisonous gas. UL Certified with a 10-year limited manufacturer's warranty.",

This easy-to-install alarm is appropriate for all living areas and comes with a 7-year life warranty and 5-year limited warranty.",
            "Consumer Benefits",
            "The Kidde 9CO5-LP will alert you and your family with a loud warning signal against the dangers of elevated carbon monoxide levels in your home. This battery-operated carbon monoxide alarm continuously monitors carbon monoxide levels, even during power outages when AC-only units are not providing protection.",
            "Technical Specifications",
            "This unit uses an electrochemical sensor, and when it detects carbon monoxide, it will alert the user with a distinct pattern. The alarm pattern is four short beeps, followed by five seconds of silence, then four more short beeps with a corresponding red LED light. This cycle will continue for four minutes and then change to one cycle every minute until the device is reset or the carbon monoxide is eliminated. In addition, the red LED light will pulse to indicate carbon monoxide has been detected until the device is reset or carbon monoxide is removed from the surrounding area. When there is no carbon monoxide present, a green LED light will flash every 30 seconds, indicating a properly operating alarm when power is present.",

We don't want to be pushy and tells you that it will solve all your problems because we don't have an answer to it but here we are listing some common questions and most popular search terms and blogs.

These reviews are 100 from customers who purchased and experienced these lamps. Every household should have this. I originally bought this for my little brother as a gift. But I wanted to make sure everything worked correctly and wasn't broken when I received it, so I plugged it up in my kitchen. After having it turned on for literally 1 minute, the room just felt warm (not hot) and homey. it kind of freaks me out how calming and relaxing the energy from this lamp makes me feel lol. Beautiful, natural, pretty, warm glow! just arrived today, and so far, I'm finding it beautiful. As to appearance, it's lovely, and soothing. The dimmer switch allows for a few different settings to adjust how bright you'd like it to go. I just turned it on and it's sitting nearby, with quite wonderful glow. The best gift you'll ever give! I fell in love with this lamp after seen it in a magazine and have given it as a Christmas, and a \"just because\" gift and it is a hit every time. A beautiful lamp I was a little concerned about the leakage that people seemed to be reporting. This seems to be a natural result of the salt lamp, depending on its environment. Though my room isn't humid during the winter. A must for my stuffy apartment. this lamp spends all night dimmed on my bedside table. I've really appreciated the soft light in the room, and I've noticed a difference in air quality. It seems to be solidly built. I've owned this lamp since August 2016, and it still looks new out of the box. Thank you very much for your time! what is in the boxes x 15-watt light bulb 1 x Himalayan salt night lamp with dimmable switch. 1 x user manual of salt lamp"

            "No more time-consuming test-adjusting to achieve the correct size. With the Knipex Cobra water pump pliers, you can simply position the upper jaw to the workpiece, push the button, and close the lower jaw. And you'll also be able to say goodbye to blood blisters you get with other gripping pliers. With safety its first priority, Knipex has designed a built-in pinch guard that prevents blood blisters on your hand.",
            "The unique self-locking adjustment and induction hardened gripping teeth means that once it's set, it stays. There's no slipping and no need to waste strength squeezing the pliers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0ensuring operator safety and more efficient work. Cobra's unique jaw configuration can grip any shape object\u00a0\u2014\u00a0flat, round, hex, or square. It also eliminates nut burring to avoid stripping pipes, nuts, or bolts. Additionally, the Cobra's newly redesigned adjustment provides 30 percent more gripping capacity than previous models.",
            "A simple push of the patented push button adjustment maintains jaw size setting and gives you the correct size opening every time. Just position the upper jaw to the workpiece, push the button, adjust the opening, and close the lower jaw. And it's easily done with just one hand for trouble-free operation in confined spaces.",
            "Cobra water pump pliers are constructed from chrome vanadium electric steel, an innovative high alloy, oil tempered steel that ensures longevity. And their thin head design helps you get into spaces other pliers can't, so there's no need to change tools when working in tight confines.",

            "Sometimes we give our pliers a really hard time. We try to destroy them to find out what makes them good and long-lasting. Because we don't want to leave anything to chance, we take a long, careful look.",
            "The steel Knipex uses is precisely hardened with a maximum of 0.8 percent carbon and defined parts of chromium and vanadium, guaranteeing optimum cutting performance and service life\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even though it requires special production and costs a bit more. But our high product demands require this.",
            "The rivet of our high-leverage diagonal cutter also has to stand up to a lot of stress. That's why we literally give it backup: we forge it straight onto the pliers. This means extra effort as we have to precision mill the rivet to a few hundredth millimeters. But satisfied users are worth this effort.",
            "Knipex also looks closely at the small details. The angles, the sharpness, the hardness, the toughness of the cutting edges. The precision and smooth movement of the joint. The handle design and the finish. We keep reviewing these subjects, we research, we test, and we improve our pliers.",
            "About Knipex",
            "Headquartered in Wuppertal, Germany, Knipex is an independently-owned family enterprise steeped in tradition and specializing in the manufacturing of high-quality pliers. It all started back in 1882 when C. Gustav Putsch set up his own forge shop in Cronenberg (now a suburb of Wuppertal), and the company is now run by a fourth generation of that family. The world's leading brand in pliers today, Knipex is focused on the performance, service life, and ergonomics of its tools in order to meet the high expectations of professional users.",

            "The Kidde Carbon Monoxide Detector, Plug In Wall with 9-Volt Battery Backup, Digital LED Display uses electrochemical sensor technology to detect poisonous CO gas in your home and alert you by sounding an 85-decibel alarm. Setup is easy as the Kidde carbon monoxide alarm plugs into a standard, 120V AC power outlet in your home, while a 9-volt alkaline battery (included) works as a backup in the event of a power failure. When carbon monoxide is detected, the digital display shows the level of carbon monoxide the alarm is sensing and updates every 15 seconds. Peak Level Memory records the last time carbon monoxide was detected or when the unit was tested. The Smart-Hush button silences the unit for approximately 8 minutes, which is helpful when this smoke detector carbon monoxide detector combo sounds from things like routine cooking or shower steam. Extension cord (included) allows for placement on a table or shelf. Install a carbon monoxide smoke detector combo on every level of your home and near bedrooms to help keep your family safe. UL Certified with a 10-year limited manufacturer's warranty.

It plugs directly into a standard A/C outlet and includes a 9-volt battery backup that provides continuous monitoring of CO levels--even during power outages.About Carbon Monoxide: The Silent KillerThe leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in North America, carbon monoxide (CO) is often referred to as the silent killer because it's odorless, tasteless, and invisible. Carbon monoxide poisoning can come about via a number of sources, including everyday items and appliances in your home or office. And because symptoms of CO poisoning mimic the flu or other common illnesses it can often go undiagnosed.Audible Alarm Pattern Alerts you to Elevated CO LevelsWhen placed on every level of your home, alarms like the KN-COPP-3 Nighthawk can help protect everyone in the house from CO exposure by giving you an unmistakable signal when levels have reached an unhealthy point. If unhealthy levels are detected, the alarm will emit four quick audible beats every five seconds until either levels decrease or the reset button is pressed.Easy-to-Read Digital Display Shows CO LevelsThe KN-COPP-3 Nighthawk is unique among traditional CO alarms because of its digital display. This display clearly shows levels of CO that the unit has detected and stored-- from 30 to 999 ppm--and it updates every 15 seconds to indicate any abrupt changes or alarming trends. The display also shows the peak CO level recorded by the alarm since it was last reset or unplugged.LED Shows Sensor StatusWith the KN-COPP-3 Nighthawk, you never have to wonder if the sensor is functioning properly. A blinking dot in the lower right-hand corner of the display denotes normal operation, so you can trust that it's working. In addition, you can test alarm function by pressing the test/reset button at any time to verify that the horn and electric circuitry are operating properly.Convenient Mounting OptionsThe KN-COPP-3 Nighthawk has a low-profile design that makes it suitable for any room in your home. The detector can be plugged into any standard A/C outlet; it's plug can be snapped into the back of the unit and can be rotated so the alarm remains vertical, independent of whether the electrical socket is mounted vertically or horizontally. In addition, the alarm comes with a 6-foot extension cord, so the unit can be plugged into the wall outlet and then placed on a table or shelf. For the most thorough protection, place an alarm on every level of your home.The UL-listed Kidde KN-COPP-3 Nighthawk has a seven-year life and is backed by a five-year limited warranty.About Kidde: A UTC Fire and Security BrandRenowned for global leadership in fire detection and suppression, Kidde provides solutions ranging from portable fire extinguishers to advanced industrial controls such as flame detection and explosion suppression systems.

The Tangle-Free Brush Roll scrubs to remove debris and minimizes annoying pet hair wrap. BISSELL\u00ae CrossWave\u00ae Pet Pro is safe for tile, sealed wood floors, laminate, linoleum, vinyl, rubber floor mats, pressed wood floors, area rugs, and more. Two-Tank Technology keeps the cleaning solution separate from the dirty water to ensure a fresh mix of formula and water is always being used to clean your floors. The included PET Multi-Surface with Febreze Formula helps eliminate pet odors on your floors. After cleaning, use the Pet Hair Strainer to separate pet hair and large debris from the dirty water in your dirt tank, so hair and debris can be disposed into the garbage and not down your sink. The special Rinse & Clean Out Storage Tray also helps you easily clean the machine after use, plus it stores the brush rolls for next time! CrossWave Pet Pro\u00ae is truly a groundbreaking multi-floor cleaner that is a must-have for homes with or without pets. And this machine doesn't just clean up after pets, it helps save them, too.

The faster you know about a fire, the faster you can start moving your family outside. The First Alert smoke alarm with silence button allows you to both silence a non-threatening alarm and to test the unit's functionality.

            "You run a tight ship at home, from floor to ceiling -- and everywhere in between. Unfortunately, ordinary home non-electrostatic air filters aren\u2019t super effective at capturing unwanted particles. GOOD NEWS: The unique design of the electrostatically charged Filtrete Basic Dust Air Filter attracts -- and trap --more particles from your air through your heating and cooling system, making quality control a breeze. With each cycle through the filter, your indoor air becomes a little bit cleaner.",
            "Amazon.com",
            "The Filtrete 300 MPR dust reduction filter not only vastly improves the air quality in your home, it also keeps your air conditioning and heating systems running efficiently, saving on utilities and maintenance costs. The electrostatic filter attracts and captures airborne dust, pollen, and other large-particle contaminants to keep surfaces in your home clean and dust-free longer. With each pass through the specially pleated filter, the air in your living space improves, making for a healthier home environment. This high-performance filter outperforms comparable non-electrostatic fiberglass and washable and reusable one-inch filters.",
            "Electrostatic Design Captures More Particles",
            "The 3M dust reduction filter is made with both positively charged and negatively charged fibers that act like tiny magnets to attract air-polluting contaminants. Since particles in the air are either positively or negatively charged, they are attracted to and captured by the filter and kept out of your living space.",
            "Electrostatic filters, including the 3M dust reduction filter, perform better than comparable non-electrostatic fiberglass and washable/reusable filters, because they attract and capture the small, allergy-aggravating microparticles that non-electrostatic filters can't.",
            "Improves Indoor Air Quality",
            "With indoor air a surprising two to five times more polluted than outdoor air, the 3M dust reduction filter can make a difference in maintaining a healthier home environment by cleaning air with each pass through the filter.",
            "Ideal for capturing large particles from the air, including household dust and pollen, the 3M dust reduction filter features a 300 Microparticle Performance Rating (MPR).",
            "Improves Efficiency",
            "This dust reduction filter also keeps your heating and air conditioning equipment working efficiently by removing dirt and reducing strain on the motor. It is recommended that you change the filter every three months. However, the effectiveness and life of the filter can vary and depend on the individual conditions in your home.",
            "About Filtrete Air Filters",
            "For nearly 25 years, Filtrete filters have delivered cleaner air to millions of homes, becoming a leader in residential air filtration. Developed by 3M engineers to help capture airborne allergens, the Filtrete filter media is electrostatically charged to act like tiny magnets to attract and capture microscopic particles from the air as it passes through the filter. Today, a dedicated technical team continues to develop innovative filtration solutions for around the home, including air cleaning filters, room air purifiers, and water filtration products.",

            "Sugru Moldable Glue is the world\u2019s first multi-purpose, multi-surface moldable glue, specifically designed to bond permanently to almost anything including ceramics, metal, glass, wood, plaster, stone, brick, rubber, most plastics and fabrics and even flexible materials. Sugru is resistant to water and high temperatures.Out of the pack, Sugru feels soft and pliable like play-dough. Stick it where you need it, and mold it by hand into any shape. From an ultra-thin, flexible patch to a robust wall hook, you have 30 minutes to shape it, smooth it and reposition as required. After application, this all-round putty hardens to a tough, shock-resistant silicone rubber within 12-24 hours (depending on the layer thickness).",

            "Sugru Moldable Glue is the world\u2019s first multi-purpose, multi-surface moldable glue, specifically designed to bond permanently to almost anything including ceramics, metal, glass, wood, plaster, stone, brick, rubber, most plastics and fabrics and even flexible materials. Sugru is resistant to water and high temperatures.Out of the pack, Sugru feels soft and pliable like play-dough. Stick it where you need it, and mold it by hand into any shape. From an ultra-thin, flexible patch to a robust wall hook, you have 30 minutes to shape it, smooth it and reposition as required. After application, this all-round putty hardens to a tough, shock-resistant silicone rubber within 12-24 hours (depending on the layer thickness).",

The seat is can be adjusted front to back up to 1/2 inch for a perfect, flush fit with your toilet bowl and is easy to remove for cleaning and replacement with Easy Clean hinges. With the innovative STA-TITE Seat Fastening System, the seat does not shift around and stays firmly attached to the toilet bowl. This seat is proudly made in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, USA and fits all manufacturers' round bowls in the US and Canada. When no longer needed, the potty seat portion can be easily and permanently removed. NOTE: Colors on a website or printed from a website can vary drastically from the actual color of the toilet seat due to monitor and printer settings.

            "Product Description",
            "Replacing a toilet flush handle can give an old toilet a new look and improve its functionality. Before starting this DIY toilet repair project note where the current toilet handle is located on your toilet tank as this Danco Replacement Toilet Handle is designed to fit a front mount toilet tank lever position. Be sure to measure your current toilet handle lift arm and be sure to check the length as this Danco toilet handle has an 8-inch arm length. Note: Lift arm length and hole positions can vary, so adjustments can be made. Installation Tip: Attach the flapper chain in the same hole position as the old toilet lever arm, flush to check its functionality; keep in mind if the chain is too long the tank will not completely drain and if it is too short the flapper will not seat properly allowing water to drain continuously so make sure to try different hole positions for the ideal flush functionality.

            "We face a myriad of challenges each and every day. Cleaning clogged drains no longer has to be one of them--thanks to the revolutionary new SinkShroom Chrome and Nickel Editions. SinkShroom fits snug inside your bathroom sink drain, all calm and collected, effortlessly gathering each and every hair that tries to make its way down your vulnerable drain. It even protects against rings and other jewelry falling into the drain. It's the hero you deserve in your bathroom.",
            "From the Manufacturer",
            "No More Clogged Drains",
            "Our customers are passionate about keeping their bathroom drains clog-free. Who wants to spend all that time cleaning out their drains or invest all that money on harmful chemicals or pricey plumber visits? Our SinkShroom solution is the best preventative measure you could take against clogged drains. It's patent-pending design is just what the drain doctor ordered.",
            "Matches Any Bathroom",
            "We know some of you want to make a statement with your bathroom accessories so we've made the new SinkShroom available in Chrome and Brushed Nickel Editions to match virtually any bathroom decor. Customers loved our original 'Shrooms but, by popular demand, we're now back with our new and improved SinkShroom. Keep your drains clear and have fun while doing it.",
            "Patent-Pending Functionality",
            "The TubShroom and SinkShroom designs have been carefully crafted to ensure optimal water-flow while preventing any hair or other objects from getting into your drains. Clogs are caused by an accumulation of hair, soap scum, and other objects.",
            "Our Universal Design",
            "The SinkShroom fits in any standard 1.25\" bathroom sink drain, which is virtually all of them out there. Most sink drains have a pop up or screw-in stopper that can be removed before placing the SinkShroom in. Other stoppers can be unscrewed from under the sink.",
            "We Love Nature",
            "Our Mushroom-like look was inspired by none other than Mother Nature. SinkShroom is made to pop out of your drain by about half an inch so water continues to flow freely while all the hair is neatly wrapped around the base, completely out of sight. Clean up is a breeze!",
            "The Drain Revolution is Here",
            "We're not fans of pollution or waste. If we can solve multiple problems with new products, then we're doing something right. Thousands of gallons of harmful chemical drain cleaners are poured down drains worldwide. Not only are the fumes dangerous, these acid-based solutions often wear pipes down quicker and go back into the environment. We hope to be able to help completely eliminate the ongoing use of these harmful options. On top of that, we wanted to create something that saves people hassle and money. With multiple pets in our household and long human hair to contend with, we were faced with the annoying task of clearing clogged drains all too often. Enter SinkShroom.",
            "About the Startup",
            "Describe your product in 3 words.",
            "Ultimate Drain Protection.",
            "How did you come up with the idea for this product?",
            "My husband and I both have long hair. And we have several pets in the house. Just try to imagine the number of times our drain has clogged over the years from all that hair and the amount of time and money we had to spend to keep it clear. There had to be a better way. It took years of brainstorming to come up with, what we think, is the perfect solution.",
            "What makes your product special?",
            "First and foremost\u2026it works great. If it solved the problem of clogged drains for us and for our friends, we're certain it will do the same for you. It's made of durable, high-quality materials that should last as long as your bathroom does. No cheap plastics that can crack and bend over time. We took the idea to the crowdfunding world and the response was overwhelming. We're proud of this little product because we feel it's a clever solution to a real problem out there. The only downside is that plumbers and drain cleaner manufacturers may not like us very much after this.",
            "What has been the best part of your startup experience?",
            "The best part was seeing the product come to life, so to speak. It's our baby now and every person that it helps along the way will bring a big old smile to our faces. The positive feedback from early supporters and early testers has motivated us to get SinkShroom in as many drains as possible. We've learned so much about the process, about ourselves, and about new ways we can potentially improve the bathroom experience down the road."

            "Product Description",
            "This handy 2-pack of FIRST ALERT CO400 Carbon Monoxide Alarms utilizes electrochemical carbon monoxide sensors to monitor your space for carbon monoxide threats. The battery-powered design doesn't require an electrician; simply insert the included 9-volt battery into each alarm, and the carbon monoxide detectors are ready to go. The advanced electrochemical CO sensors detect carbon monoxide leaks from multiple sources, such as faulty fuel-burning appliances, blocked chimneys, and generators running inside or too close to homes. When CO levels become elevated, a loud 85-decibel alarm alerts you to the threat. Because CO evenly distributes itself, it's important to have a CO detector on every level and in every bedroom of your home. Designed to be simple to use, each CO detector has just one button that silences or tests the unit, as well as an end-of-life timer that lets you know when it's time to replace the device. Carbon monoxide (CO) is the leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in America, yet many people don't know they are suffering from CO poisoning until it's too late. Since symptoms of CO poisoning are like the flu, you might not even know you're in danger at first. That's why a carbon monoxide alarm is an excellent way to protect your family. It can detect the CO you can't see, smell, or taste in the air. The FIRST ALERT CO400-3 carbon monoxide alarm uses an electrochemical carbon monoxide sensor, the most accurate technology available. The permanent sensor lasts up to five years. It is powered by 1-9V replaceable battery per alarm giving you peace of mind even during power outages. The test/silence button both silences the alarm and allows you to test its functionality. The unit monitors and re-alarms if carbon monoxide levels persist, sounding a loud 85-decibel horn. No installation is required and the attractive design allows the unit to be placed anywhere you need it. It includes an optional wall mount with no outlet required. An audible and visual low battery signal alerts you to replace the battery. Pull down action chart has convenient guide on what to do if an alarm sounds. For use in all 50 states; compliant with current CO Laws in California, Wisconsin, and Oregon. 5 year limited warranty. UL listed.",

The unique six-point design allows the socket to grip flat against the fastener wall to have a stronger grip while loosening without rounding off the corners. A must-have when working on any vehicle. Constructed from high strength Cr-V steel with a durable black phosphate finish to fight against corrosion better than your traditional black oxide finish, the NEIKO 02474A is a set that gets the job done time and time again. With laser etched size markings with each metric size on your sockets, finding the right fit is a snap. This set was made to pair perfectly with your impact tools and with the extra deep walls, you can easily free rusty suspensions and even crank bolts with ease by transferring torque from wrench to lug nut."

            "This tool tower maximizes available space while still being slim enough to not take up a lot of space. It holds up to 40 tools. It has a molded-in weed trimmer and electric cord holder. Casters make for simple mobility. It is easy to assemble and will not rust, dent, rot or peel.",
            "Amazon.com",
            "Store and organize over 36 tools for easy access and more floor space with this garden tool rack organizer from Rubbermaid. The tool tower stores rakes, brooms, snow shovels, and gas-powered weed eaters for easy access and more floor space in the garage or shed. Front clips allow head-down storage of spades and brooms to simplify access and so that the rack doesn't get top heavy. The clips also enable easy slide-in storage from the side, rather than having to come in from above and sliding the handle into the slot. Four castors mean easy transport of all those tools from one place to another--a feature that makes it easy to relocate all those tools in one easy move, rather than 36 moves. Two of the casters lock to keep the unit in place. The base of the tower has a grid pattern to keep tools from sliding off. --Brian D. Olson",

This alarm measures the exposure to carbon monoxide over time; it is designed to sound at 85 decibels at 10 feet when it detects 70 ppm (parts per million) of CO for 60 to 240 minutes, 150 ppm for 10 to 50 minutes, or 400 ppm for 4 to 15 minutes. The easily visible digital display indicates the level of CO that the unit is sensing, and it updates the status every 15 seconds for timely and accurate readings. Its free-standing design allows for attachment to a wall or placement on a counter or nightstand for convenient and comprehensive protection. The KN-COPP-LPM also includes a slide-out battery door that provides immediate access to the power source as well as a battery safeguard that makes it difficult to close the cover without batteries installed. An LED lighting system on the unit signals power levels and sourcing: the green LED will flash once every 30 seconds to indicate the alarm is operating properly when power is present, and the red LED will pulse to indicate carbon monoxide has been detected until the device is reset or the CO threat is eliminated. This device has an expected 7-year lifespan and comes equipped with a five-year manufacturer\u2019s limited warranty.",

            "The 3M Rugged Comfort Quick Latch Half Facepiece Reusable Respirator 6500 Series helps provide workers with respiratory protection in harsh, dirty work environments against airborne contaminants when used with approved 3M cartridges and filters. This facepiece combines comfort, durability, and stability with a firm, lightly textured silicone faceseal and strong body construction. The proprietary quick latch design offers an easy, one-hand touch drop-down mechanism for putting the facepiece on and taking it off while moving in and out of contaminated areas. The quick latch also eliminates the need to remove a hardhat or faceshield when lowering or raising the respirator. When properly fitted and used with approved 3M cartridges and filters, this respirator helps provide respiratory protection in workplaces at concentrations up to 10 times the Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). While being the lightest silicone 3M half facepiece, it is still rugged enough to withstand long hours and extreme conditions. The resilient silicone faceseal offers an extended facepiece life, even keeping its shape in high-heat environments. Innovative design features include a valve cover that helps to direct exhaled breath and moisture downward and 3M\u2019s proprietary Cool Flow Valve that helps to make breathing easier. Made to fit securely and comfortably on the head, the facepiece comes with an adjustable head harness assembly featuring long-lasting polyester/spandex straps that stretch and conform to the individual who wears the respirator. This facepiece is compatible with all 3M bayonet-style filters and cartridges to help provide respiratory protection against a variety of gases, vapors, and particulate hazards (i.e., dust, paint aerosols, etc.) according to NIOSH approvals. This filter compatibility helps to make the respirator highly versatile for many workplace environments and a variety of jobs where respiratory protection is required. Warning: Respirators help protect against certain airborne contaminants. Before use, the wearer must read and understand the User Instructions provided as a part of the product packaging. Follow all local regulations. In the U.S., a written respiratory protection program must be implemented meeting all the requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 including training, fit testing and medical evaluation. In Canada, CSA standards Z94.4 requirements must be met and/or requirements of the applicable jurisdiction, as appropriate. Misuse may result in sickness or death. Compatible With: Line Compressed Air System SA Series."

            "Newborn 930-GTD Drip-Free Smooth Hex Rod Cradle Caulking Gun with Gator Trigger Comfort Grip, 1/10 Gallon Cartridge, 10:1 Thrust RatioThe Newborn 930-GTD Drip-Free Smooth Hex Rod Cradle caulking gun has a steel half-barrel frame that fits 1/10-gal. cartridges and has a 10:1 thrust ratio for use with low viscosity materials such as latex. The smooth pressure rod requires less force and is quieter than a ratchet-style pressure rod. The rod retracts after each pull of the trigger, removing pressure from the tube to help prevent dripping. The handle and trigger are padded for comfort. There is a welded plate in the back for securing the cartridge in place. A seal puncture tool and a spout cutter are built into the side of gun for opening cartridges without a knife, and the hook on the back allows it to hang on a ladder. Caulking guns, also called caulk or cartridge guns, dispense a controlled flow of products such as caulk, sealants, and adhesives from a tube or cartridge. A manual caulking gun consists of a frame which holds the tube, a trigger, and a rod which moves forward when the trigger is depressed, dispensing the product. Manual caulking guns have a thrust ratio; the higher the thrust ratio, the easier it is to dispense the caulk, sealant, or adhesive. Air-powered or pneumatic caulking guns also have a frame and a trigger, but are used with an air pressure regulator that pushes the product from the tube using air pressure instead of a rod. Newborn Brothers Company, Inc. manufactures sealant and adhesive dispensers and accessories. The company was founded in 1974 and is headquartered in Jessup, MD.Gorilla Heavy Duty Construction Adhesive, 9 Ounce Cartridge, White, (Pack of 1)Gorilla Heavy Duty Construction Adhesive is a tough, versatile, all-weather adhesive. It\u2019s 100% adhesive formula provides a long-lasting, heavy duty bond. We call it All Surface, All Purpose. The durable, 100% waterproof formula holds up indoors and out and bonds virtually anything including subfloor, mirrors, trim, drywall, landscaping, bath surrounds, foam board, marble and more! Directions: All surfaces should be clean and free of dirt, grease and oil. Heavy items may require temporary support. Use in conjunction with mechanical fasteners when hanging large mirrors. 1. Unscrew nozzle, cut tip of cartridge, replace nozzle and cut to desired bead size. Insert into cartridge gun. 2. Apply adhesive to one surface in a zig-zag pattern or inside perimeter of the object. Be careful of squeeze-out. When working on rough, uneven surfaces, use enough adhesive to fill gaps. 3. Within 10 minutes, press surfaces together and hold for 20-60 seconds.

            "The First Alert CO605 Plug-In Carbon Monoxide Alarm with Battery Backup utilizes an electrochemical carbon monoxide sensor to accurately and effectively warn you of elevated CO levels. The plug-in design and included battery backup mean your space can be continuously monitored for dangerous carbon monoxide gas, even during power outages. Simply plug the alarm into a 120-volt outlet, and the personal carbon monoxide detector is ready to go. When CO levels rise above a safe threshold, a loud 85-decibel alarm alerts you to the threat. Designed for simple use, the CO detector has just 1 button that silences or tests the unit, as well as an end-of-life timer that lets you know when it is time to replace the device.Simple and Easy to Use: The carbon monoxide monitor is easy to set up: simply plug it into a standard electrical outlet to monitor your space for carbon monoxide. There are no complicated displays or settings to navigate; a single button silences the alarm and tests the CO detector."

            "Invented in England in 1963, Lava Lamps exploded in popularity in the US in the mid 1970s and then again in the early 1990s. Today, they are still as mesmerizing as ever. Both timeless and illuminating, this Lava Lite 14.5 In. Classic Motion Lava Lamp (Yellow/Blue/Silver) will not only bring back memories, they'll help create brand new ones too. Nothing beats a classic.",
            "From the Manufacturer",
            "This is the original Lava Lamp! Lava. Its ever-changing patterns are hypnotizing, yet invigorating. It is an art form. Classic and at the same time progressive. It is pre-historic and post-modern. Lava is the core of Lava Lite. Our Lava Lamps range from small to gigantic and from subtle to overwhelming. Each Lava Lamp is filled with our hypnotizing mesmerizing lava blobatude (goo for those less technical). Simply stated, if you need lava we\u2019ve got a lamp for every nook and cranny in your pad. You must wait 8 hours after initial plug in of your Lava Lamp for it work properly. They're perfect for relaxing, decorating, or light up a party.Troubleshooting steps : During initial warm-up of your Lava Lamp, the coil in the globe may tend to stand on end or float to the top of the globe. If this happens, keep your Lava Lamp operating for four-hours or more to allow the secret solution to become completely melted. The coil should then automatically drop to its correct position at the bottom of the globe. If the coil does not drop down, then twirl the globe GENTLY in the base and the coil will drop. Do not shake and handle with care! Note:The item works by having an 25 Watt incandescent light bulb warm wax held in a liquid. Operation is simply the turning on of a switch to light the bulb"

            "InSinkErator Garbage Disposal, Badger 5, 1/2 HP Continuous Feed,BlackFor over 75 years InSinkErator has been known for building the world's best food waste disposers. Badger, our standard disposer line, is basic, reliable, and functional. Available in various models and sizes for a range of applications, InSinkErator also manufactures a premier line of disposers, the Evolution Series. InSinkErator food waste disposers are the only disposers that are proudly made in the U.S.A. InSinkErator has grown into the largest food waste disposer manufacturer and best-selling garbage disposer brand in the world. This disposer must be grounded to reduce the risk of electric shock in the event of a malfunction or breakdown. Grounding provides a path of least resistance for electric current. If your disposer did not include a factory installed power cord, use a cord having an equipment-grounding conductor and a grounding plug. (InSinkErator power cord accessory CRD-00 recommended.) The plug must be plugged into an outlet that is properly installed and grounded in accordance with all local codes and ordinancesInSinkErator STS-OOSN SinkTop Satin Nickel Button Dual Outlet SwitchInSinkErator STS-OOSN SinkTop Satin Nickel Button Dual Outlet Switch"

The universal angle & try square lets you determine and transfer distances and angular measurements with ease. Being guided by the sturdy limit stop and hole line means you can effortlessly draw parallel lines with a pencil. You can quickly dismantle the limit stop on the angle rail so you can mark or measure surfaces precisely. For transferring curves and circles to workpieces, you simply use the universal angle as a compass. The two fixed radii on the angle measuring scale allow you to quickly transfer curves, e.g. for rounded corners on boards. The angle acts as a stable leading edge when using a jigsaw. It will quickly become indispensable when laying laminate or making furniture. Whether you need an integrated 45\u00b0 limit stop, 32-hole line or drilling template for concealed hinges, with the universal angle & try square, you'll be well-equipped to take on any project."

The digital display shows if gas is present indicates CO levels in parts per million, allowing you to see if, how, and when levels change.",
            "Advanced Technology in an Easy-to-Install, Plug-In Design",
            "Designed for home use, the Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is a UL-listed, A/C-powered, plug-in alarm that utilizes sophisticated electronic components and sensor technology to protect you and your family from the dangers of CO, methane, and propane exposure. It plugs directly into a standard A/C outlet and includes a 9-volt battery backup that provides continuous monitoring--even during power outages.",

            "The leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in North America, carbon monoxide (CO) is often referred to as the silent killer because it's odorless, tasteless, and invisible. Carbon monoxide poisoning can come about via a number of sources, including everyday items and appliances in your home or office. And because symptoms of CO poisoning mimic the flu or other common illnesses it can often go undiagnosed.",
            "Likewise, methane and propane gases are commonly used in homes for cooking, heating, and water heating. Although it happens rarely, gas leaks can sometimes occur inside the home, increasing the risk of fire or explosion.",
            "Audible Alarm Pattern Alerts you to Elevated CO and Gas Levels",
            "When placed on every level of your home, alarms like the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk can help protect everyone in the house by giving you an unmistakable signal when gas levels have reached an unhealthy point. If unhealthy levels of CO are detected, the alarm will emit four quick audible beeps every five seconds until either levels decrease or the reset button is pressed. If methane gas or propane gas is detected, the alarm will emit beeps every other second with \"GAS\" shown in the display.",
            "Easy-to-Read Digital Display Shows CO Levels",
            "The KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is preferred among traditional CO and explosive gas alarms because of its digital display. This display clearly shows levels of CO that the unit has detected and stored-- from 30 to 999 ppm--and it updates every 15 seconds to indicate any abrupt changes or alarming trends. The display also shows the peak CO level recorded by the alarm since it was last reset or unplugged. The continuous display also shows if gas is present.",
            "LED Shows Sensor Status",
            "With the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk, you never have to wonder if the sensor is functioning properly. A blinking dot in the lower right-hand corner of the display denotes normal operation, so you can trust that it's working. In addition, you can test alarm function by pressing the test/reset button at any time to verify that the horn and electric circuitry are operating properly.",
            "Convenient Mounting Options",
            "The KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk has a low-profile design that makes it suitable for any room in your home. The detector can be plugged into any standard A/C outlet; it's plug can be snapped into the back of the unit and can be rotated so the alarm remains vertical, independent of whether the electrical socket is mounted vertically or horizontally. In addition, the alarm comes with a 6-foot extension cord, so the unit can be plugged into the wall outlet and then placed on a table or shelf.

            "While home tap water may look clean, it can contain contaminants picked up on its journey through aging pipes. For cleaner, great-tasting water, remember to change your PUR faucet water filter. This easy-to-change PUR faucet mount water filter fits in all PUR faucet water filtration systems. Each replacement water filter provides 100 gallons of filtered water or lasts up to 3 months of typical use.  PUR RF3375 faucet water filter replacements are NSF & WQA certified to reduce 70 contaminants.\u023d A compatible filter does not mean comparable! PUR faucet filtration system filter replacements are certified to reduce lead and 10x more contaminants than Brita's leading pitcher filter.*\u023d Be cautious of 'off-brand' filters. They are not tested or certified to filter the same as PUR filters. PUR filters are the only filters certified to reduce contaminants when used with PUR systems.\u023d  PUR is the #1 selling brand in faucet filtration** PUR has been developing innovative technologies for superior water filtration for over 30 years. We believe life deserves PUR water.  Disclaimers:  *Versus best-selling Brita\u00ae pitcher filter OB03. Brita\u00ae is a trademark of Brita LP.  **Based on Nielsen sales data for the 52 weeks ending 08/28/21.  \u023d PUR does not filter microbes."

            "Using scissors to cut through tough stuff like plastic packaging is no fun, especially when you suffer from hands that fatigue quickly. Not only was the ZipSnip Cutting Tool designed to do all the jobs that scissors can\u2019t, but it also makes everyday cutting jobs that much easier. Its self-sharpening blade slices right through cardboard, so it\u2019s an excellent tool for taking out the recyclables. It even glides through rubber and leather, so it\u2019s an indispensable implement for crafting and/or DIY projects. It\u2019s precise, much more so than scissors, and has a lot more power behind it than a utility knife. It\u2019s perfect for opening heavy bags like pet food, seed, or fertilizer without spilling because you don\u2019t need a lot of motion to use it, like with knives and scissors. It has a soft grip, so it\u2019s comfortable to use, and the compact design only weighs 1 pound. The lockout switch prevents accidental starts. And it\u2019ll hold a charge for months, so you can keep it in a kitchen drawer and it\u2019ll be ready to go whenever you need it. A charger is included, so you can refill the 4v battery whenever the on-board charge light lets you know it\u2019s time. And it\u2019s great for outdoor use\u2014 keep one in the garage or shed and use it for detailed landscaping. The rake was a handy tool until the leaf blower came along. And scissors were nice before the invention of the ZipSnip. Give your hands a break, get a ZipSnip. Status indicator lets you know when the battery is fully charged."

A single Light Dim is a perfect LED blocker or dimmer. LightDims are easy to use, just peel and stick. It does not matter how old you are, we are all surrounded by electronics and their tiny LED lights. Have you ever wanted that LED light to dim? Do you have trouble sleeping? Do you wear glasses? If you have had eye surgery like Lasik, halos can be annoying at the very least or painful, making the eyes sensitive to light. Cataracts or any issue with your eyes can give you an increase in light sensitivity. Do you feel like you are being bombarded with bright LED's, Light-Dims can help."

            "Why Do You Need These Shooting Ear Muffs?",
            "Loud noises can cause permanent hearing loss and even accelerate the process of becoming deaf. The need for hearing protection is often misunderstood and underestimated. Noise levels above 125 decibels for even short periods of time, can cause permanent hearing loss. When exposed to these decibels for longer periods of time the effects are even worse. Our high Noise Reduction Rating (26NRR) Ear Muffs are one of the best ways to protect your hearing from damage.",

            "Meet your new favorite workhorse, the Pegasus. This multi-function work table and sawhorse with quick clamps and holding pegs can support up to 300 lbs as a table, and up to 1,000 lbs as a sawhorse! The legs lock into place and are made of tough molded ABS with steel supports, and the non-slip feet stay in place on both grass and pavement. Yet the Pegasus itself is only 25 lbs, so you can fold it up and carry it anywhere, or keep it in the back of the truck. The integrated clamping system exerts up to 300 lbs of force to keep your project firmly in place, and has a max clamping width of 18 \u00bc\u201d. And the clamp dog pegs allow you to secure round and oddly shaped materials. This table is 31\u201d x 25\u201d and is a standard 32\u201d high, so it can be linked up with our other Worx tables, and other Pegasuses, to make a longer, fully-functional work table. (Link locks are included.) And the folding tray at the base is designed to hold tools, power strips, or anything you need on the job. The Pegasus is tough and solid enough to be a permanent work table or sawhorse but built to be portable, so you can take it from job to job, or from the basement to the garage without a problem. And it folds down to a depth of only 5\u201d, so it\u2019s easy to store when you\u2019re not going to be using it for a while."

            "Let Lutron's Maestro Occupancy/Vacancy Motion Sensor Switch turn the lights on and off for you. This sensor is a simple way to save energy and add light automation to any room of your home, turning lights on when you enter the room and off when you exit. It features XCT (cross-correlation) sensing technology to detect fine motion, such as typing at a desk or reading a book, to ensure lights won\u2019t turn off inadvertently when you\u2019re still in the room. It also learns your preferred natural light level and keeps lights off with smart ambient light detection. Program your lights to turn off 1, 5, 15, or 30 minutes after you leave the room. Alternatively, you can set the motion sensor to vacancy-only mode to only turn off the lights when you leave a room, to meet Title 24 requirements. Great for many locations such as bathrooms, laundry rooms, kitchens, and garages for added convenience and energy savings. This sensor works with any bulb type, including CFL and LED. It matches the entire Maestro product family line (sold separately) to give you a complete and coordinated look in your home. Install using the ground wire if no neutral is available in your home. Coordinating Claro wall plate and accessories sold separately."

            "The world is in constant evolution, consumer products and the consumer\u2019s buying habits and preferences are no different. During this evolution, we have strived to offer the consumer the most well balanced quality lighting instruments in the marketplace and that superb product quality is how we\u2019ve maintained a trusted brand over the past four decades.",
            "Amazon.com",
            "With its high-intensity adjustable light beam and compact size, the Mini Maglite Two-Cell AA Flashlight and Holster Combo Pack offers limitless around-the-house and on-the-go options. This slender flashlight succeeds where flimsy plastic flashlights fail, providing a steady, fast-focus stream of light wherever and whenever you need it. For easy portability, the flashlight comes with a nylon holster with belt loop.",
            "Compact Flashlight Provides Limitless Uses",
            "Whether you're hunting for something in the back of your closet, changing a fuse, looking for something behind the couch, or checking under the hood of your car, you'll appreciate the Mini Maglite's simple, straightforward, and reliable design.",
            "With an overall length of only 5.75 inches and a weight of just 3.8 ounces (with included batteries), the Mini Maglite is easy to handle and hold, even when working in tight spaces.",

            "Three Light Modes for Versatility",
            "The Mini Maglite boasts a unique candle mode that allows you to remove the head and expose the bulb to shed light in all directions, just like a candle. You can flip the head over and place it on a solid surface to create a sturdy holder for the \"candle\"--a great option when you're camping, at an outdoor concert, or entertaining after dark in your backyard.",
            "This handy flashlight also has spot and flood modes--simply rotate the head half a turn to choose the light intensity you need.",

            "Maglite: An Icon of American Ingenuity",
            "Prior to the introduction of the Maglite flashlight in 1979, flashlights were generally regarded as unreliable, throw-away items. That all changed when Anthony Maglica revolutionized the portable lighting industry with his unique technology. By combining superior design with reliability, durability, and an unprecedented lifetime warranty, Maglite produces reliable, iconic flashlights that are designed exclusively in the USA and are built by American workers.",

            "Painting your car can be a long and laborious task at the best of times. Primer, undercoats and topcoats are needed and therefore you will have to purchase three different tins of paint to get the job done, until now.Hammerite Metal Paint can be applied directly onto rusty metal thanks to a formula that has been developed to be a primer, undercoat and topcoat in one. It gives a brilliant gloss finish that is smooth to touch whilst forming a barrier that not only seals out moisture and gives long lasting protection, both inside and out. Easy to use, apply it on ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Comes in smooth dark green in a 250ml tin.The Hammerite range is designed to protect metalwork from humidity, rain and rust."

            "Product Description",
            "The Kidde Smoke Detector, 9-Volt Battery Operated, Ionization Smoke Alarm, Battery Included, model i9050, is a basic smoke detector that uses ionization sensor technology to detect invisible fire particles (associated with flaming fires) sooner than photoelectric alarms. When smoke or fire is detected, an 85-decibel alarm will sound. The Kidde Smoke Detector is powered by a 9-volt battery, which provides easy installation since the alarm requires no wiring, plus coverage during a power failure. A solid green LED indicates that the alarm is receiving power and a red LED indicates that the smoke detector is sensing smoke or fire. A test-hush button allows you to test the battery operations as well as silence nuisance alarms that may occur from cooking or shower steam. The Kidde Smoke Detector will chirp when it's time to replace the battery. Install a smoke detector & carbon monoxide detector on every level of your home and near bedrooms to help keep your family safe from fire & poisonous gas. UL Certified with a 10-year limited manufacturer's warranty. Meets requirements of UL 217, NFPA72 (chapter 11 2002 edition), NFPA101 (One and two-family dwellings), and Federal Housing Authority (FHA).",

At a Glance i9050 Battery-Operated Basic Smoke Alarm At a Glance: Easy installation--no wiring required Powered by 9-volt battery for continuous protection even during power failures Flashing LED shows alarm is receiving power Low-battery indicator 10-year limited warranty At a Glance Features This basic battery-operated smoke alarm is powered by a 9-volt battery (included), providing continuous protection even during power outages. It includes a flashing red LED to indicate the alarm is receiving power as well as a test button to verify the unit's electronic circuitry, horn, and battery functions are working properly. During a smoke incident, a piezo-electric horn (rated at 85 decibels at 10 feet) will sound in a repetitive manner--three beeps, a pause, three beeps, a pause. It also offers a low-battery warning and a tamper-resistant feature that deters removal of the unit from the wall or ceiling. It's backed by a 10-year limited warranty. The Kidde i9050 smoke alarm uses ionization sensing technology, which generally detects invisible fire particles (associated with flaming fires) sooner than photoelectric alarms. Photoelectric sensing alarms may detect visible particles (associated with smoldering fires) sooner than ionization alarms. Kidde recommends that both ionization and photoelectric smoke alarms be installed to insure maximum detection.
