If you need additional help with determining the right wiper blade size for your car, reference our Blade Finder or Amazon's Confirmed Fit program. If you need help with installing your new wiper blades, installation videos can be found by scanning the QR code on the back of your wiper blade\u2019s packaging."

            "Rain-X, a recognized and respected name in wiper blades for almost 20 years, is committed to providing you with the confidence of improved driving visibility. For over 15 years, Rain-X WeatherBeater (the original WeatherBeater wiper blade) is still known and trusted for its quality, durability, and value. WeatherBeater has been designed to be a high-quality traditional wiper blade that meets or exceeds all original equipment manufacturers' standards for quality, durability, and construction. This conventional blade features a natural rubber squeegee, a classic galvanized steel frame, multiple pressure points, and embedded friction reducers. The natural rubber squeegee provides resistance to cracking and splitting caused by weather, windshield wiper fluid, and road salt. The galvanized steel frame provides long-lasting strength and durability while also preventing rust and corrosion. Multiple pressure points and embedded friction reducers enable even pressure distribution across the length of the blade and help provide a clean wipe. If you need additional help with determining the right wiper blade size for your car, reference our Blade Finder or Amazon's Confirmed Fit program. If you need help with installing your new wiper blades, installation videos can be found by scanning the QR code on the back of your wiper blade\u2019s packaging."

            "Meet the GENIUS1, one of our most powerful, highest-performing, energy-efficient, and compact portable universal battery chargers yet. The GENIUS1 is a 1-amp (15-watt) - 100-240VAC 50-60Hz - 6-volt and 12-volt heavy-duty battery charger, battery maintainer, trickle charger, float charger, and battery desulfator for up to 30 amp-hours. It's designed to charge and maintain all types of sealed lead-acid and lithium-ion (lifepo4) batteries, including flooded, gel, maintenance-free, AGM, SLA, VRLA, as well as automotive, marine, RV, powersports, and deep-cycle batteries. Its advanced battery repair regenerator mode uses slow pulse reconditioner technology to automatically detect battery sulfation and acid stratification, restoring lost battery performance for extended battery life. It can be used and stored almost anywhere - home, garage, mobile, bench, or in car - to charge and maintain any battery - even plug in through your vehicle's 12V auxiliary cigarette lighter port. Its next-generation charging regime utilizes fast charging microprocessor technology to rapidly recharge batteries without any manual intervention. It's a completely automatic, worry-free, professional, and commercial-grade intelligent battery charger with zero overcharge. Designed to be dual purpose - both indoors and outdoors - providing weatherproof and waterproof protection from the outside elements during any time of the year, including winter. Its X-Connect battery connectors - better than SAE - allow for quick-connect permanent connection or connecting directly to the battery terminals. A digital display provides the charging status and tests diagnostics for multiple conditions such as a dead battery, bad battery, reverse polarity, and more. And it's compatible with all types of gas and diesel vehicles, including cars, automobiles, motorcycles, dirt bikes, scooters, mopeds, lawn mowers, ATVs, UTVs, lawn tractors, trailers, trucks, SUVs, boats, campers, RVs, jet skis, PWCs, wave runners, snowmobiles, 4-wheelers, generators, golf carts, classic cars, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Bentley, Maserati, Lexus, VW, Audi, Ford, Chevrolet, Corvette, Cadillac, Jeep, Prius, Toyota, Subaru, Nissan, Honda, Harley-Davidson, Suzuki, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Ducati, KTM, Indian, Husqvarna, Vespa, Polaris, Seadoo, John Deere and more."

It removes air from the break, fills it with durable resin and makes it even stronger than before. For best results, repairs should be made as soon as possible after the damage occurs and before the break is contaminated by dirt or water. In addition, avoid the use of glass treatments after the crack has formed and prior to repair. However, glass treatments can be applied one (1) week after repair. The kit works best on round damage not more than one inch in diameter, and cracks not longer than 12 inches. It will not repair damage to more than one layer of glass."

            "The Microfiber Premium Grade Applicators are the ideal choice for applying wax, sealant, glaze, dressing or conditioners. These microfiber applicator pads are inside stitched two times to ensure that the edges never touch the surface of your paint which reduces surface scratches and improves the application of the product. These applicator pads are professional grade and gentle, yet are strong and highly absorbent. This premium 100 percent machine washable micro fiber fabric is wrapped around a plush, dura foam sponge. These applicator pads are engineered to deliver just the right amount of product without saturating the sponge or retaining product which leads to waste. These microfiber applicators allow wax, polish, dressings and sealants to be spread more evenly, resulting in maximum coverage while using less emulsion and saving time and money. These pads are 100 percent machine washable but it is recommended that they be washed separately to ensure they remain lint free. As with all microfiber products, they should never be exposed to fabric softener as it will reduce static properties and cause the pad to clean and spread less effectively."

Have no worries - STA-BIL Storage is an additive meant just for what you\u2019re looking for. STA-BIL Storage keeps gas fresh for up to 24 months. This eliminates the need to drain fuel before storing your equipment and ensures quick easy starts the next time you go to fire it up. This product is highly effective in all gasoline, including ethanol and non-ethanol blended fuels. Whether using 87, 91, or 93 octane gas ethanol or non-ethanol blended gas still goes bad. This product is great for bulk gas storage, as well as collector cars, small engines, generators, and boats. Treat rate is 1oz to 2 \u00bd gallons of gas. If using with small engine equipment it is best to add STA-BIL Storage to your gas can. This way every piece of equipment you fill with that can is treated. Make sure to add STA-BIL while the gas is fresh. Best practice is to add STA-BIL when you are at the pump."

Powerful hyper surfactants cut through dirt and grime, lift them from sensitive automotive paintwork with billions of scrubbing bubbles, then safely lubricate and guide them off the paint for a scratch-free wash.

Honeydew Snow Foam is gentle and surface safe so it can clean any area of your vehicle from wheels to paintwork. The pH-balanced formula even allows you to wash your car or truck in direct sunlight. Honeydew Snow Foam rinses clean every time with no residue for a clean surface that will grab attention.",

            "Product Description",
            "Castrol EDGE is Castrol\u2019s most advanced engine oil. It is a premium full synthetic oil that is designed for consumers who demand the best performance from their cars. Castrol EDGE is recommended by leading car manufacturers. Castrol EDGE is engineered with fluid titanium technology that physically changes the way the oil behaves under pressure. As a result of increased demand for performance and fuel economy, pressures in today\u2019s engines have almost doubled over the last three decades. Greater pressure means more stress for the oil and the potential for more friction. As metal to metal contact increases, it causes wear and reduces performance. Underneath the hood, the pressure can reach 10 tons per square centimeter. That\u2019s like five cars resting on a high heel relying only on a micro thin layer of oil for protection. So you need a strong oil to reduce friction, and to help increase horsepower and fuel economy. To combat the increased pressures faced in today\u2019s engines, Castrol EDGE is engineered with fluid titanium technology that physically changes the way the oil behaves under pressure. Castrol\u2019s patented titanium technology provides documented performance in friction reduction, anti-wear and deposit control protection. The titanium-based technology ensures performance and strength",
            "Amazon.com",
            "Motor oil is made from crude oil and is used to lubricate, clean, and cool engines. Types of motor oil include conventional, synthetic, diesel, bio-based, hybrid (blends of conventional and synthetic), and recycled oils. Motor oil varies in weight and viscosity, as well as additives that some manufacturers add to the oil during the refining process. A numerical code system created by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) grades motor oils according to viscosity--the higher the number between 0 and 60, the more viscous (thicker) the oil is. Most consumer motor oils are graded by two numbers, with the first number indicating cold weather (Winter or \"W\") performance.",
            "SAE 5W-20",
            "This oil has a weight of SAE 5W-20, meaning it has an SAE viscosity rating of 5 in cold temperatures and a rating of 20 at normal operating temperature. Always check your vehicle's owner's manual to verify that this is the correct weight of motor oil for your vehicle.",
            "Full Synthetic Oil",
            "This oil is a full synthetic oil, meaning crude oil is not used in making it. Synthetic oil can be used in vehicle engines instead of motor oils refined from crude oil, and often provides superior mechanical performance over traditional motor oil, including increased gas mileage and reduced engine wear at extreme temperatures. Its complex method of production means it can often cost more than conventional motor oil."

            "Choose the Philips RacingVision range if you're a passionate driver wanting the rally look in a stylish, road legal package. With up to 150% more brightness on the road than standard, you'll experience a safer and more exhilarating driving experience. Driving on poorly lit roads at night can be dangerous. You rely on the performance of your headlights to help you spot potential hazards quickly. Philips RacingVision bulbs are up to 150% brighter than standard, helping you to identify potential dangers quicker and more easily, both on and off-road. The colour temperature of the RacingVision range allows your eyes to focus better, helping you to see obstacles easily for an exciting driving experience. Passionate drivers enjoy being challenged on the road. During the winter months, the weather can be unforgiving, and you need the best light possible to navigate through tougher conditions. Thanks to their brightness, Philips RacingVision bulbs provide optimal visibility for extra control in darker, more dangerous conditions. Philips RacingVision bulbs are manufactured using innovative, high-quality materials. UV-Quartz glass, a high-precision chrome coating, an up to 13-bar high-pressure gas filling and an optimised high-precision filament produce a very bright light that's engineered for a relaxed, controlled and fun driving experience. Please note: due to their increased brightness, these bulbs are expected to have a shorter lifespan."

            "A powerful blend of oils and additives that contain no SOLVENTS. Designed to increase power and fuel mileage and also lower exhaust emissions through a more complete combustion. Lucas Fuel Treatment is formulated for both gasoline and diesel engines, carbureted or fuel injected. It gives your fuel system what it really needs - a blend of super slick oils and additives with a high detergent action that allows the engine to operate at maximum efficiency. Also, it cleans and lubricates the carburetor and injectors and causes the fuel to burn more thoroughly for increased power and less fuel consumption. Lucas Fuel Treatment should definitely be used in vehicles that require leaded fuel because it actually replaces the benefits of lead in gasoline without causing harmful emissions. Use it to pass smog tests. Finally, it totally neutralizes the harmful effects of low sulfur diesel fuel. Lucas Fuel Treatment complies with the federal low sulfur content requirements for use in diesel motor vehicles and non-road, locomotive and marine diesel equipment engines. The recommended dosage is 2-3 ounces of Fuel Treatment for every 10 gallons of gasoline or diesel fuel. Pour Lucas Fuel Treatment directly into fuel tank. Exceeding the recommended dosage is not harmful to your vehicle. 5.25oz Bottle - One bottle treats up to 25 gallons of fuel. 1 Quart/32oz Bottle - One bottle treats up to 100 gallons of fuel. 1 Gallon/128oz Bottle - One bottle treats up to 400 gallons of fuel."

            "Make your tow vehicle and trailer more secure by keeping them locked up tight with a CURT hitch lock. Like a hitch pin and clip, a hitch lock is designed to insert into the fastener hole in the side of a receiver tube in order to hold a ball mount or hitch-mounted accessory in place. While a CURT hitch pin does offer sufficient strength for keeping your ball mount firmly attached, a CURT hitch lock goes one step further. CURT hitch locks allow you to lock your ball mount into your trailer hitch, deterring theft and preventing anyone from detaching your trailer at the ball mount and towing away your property without your permission. This CURT hitch lock features a barbell design and comes with a 5/8\" pin diameter to fit a 2\" receiver tube size (usable pin length is 2.850\"; will not work with double-walled receiver tubes). CURT barbell hitch locks are comprised of a pin with two end caps and a round locking mechanism. They are key-operated and activate with a simple 1/4-turn. They also come with a watertight dust cap to keep out the elements and prevent corrosion. For the ultimate in towing security, a hitch lock and coupler lock used together will provide security at both the vehicle-side and trailer-side of your towing setup. For your boat, ATV or camper, keep your toys more secure with CURT hitch locks."

            "Meet the GENIUS10, one of our most powerful, highest-performing, energy-efficient, and compact portable universal battery chargers yet. The GENIUS10 is a 10-amp (150-watt) - 100-240VAC 50-60Hz - 6-volt and 12-volt heavy-duty battery charger, battery maintainer, trickle charger, float charger, and battery desulfator for up to 230 amp-hours. It's designed to charge and maintain all types of sealed lead-acid and lithium-ion (lifepo4) batteries, including flooded, gel, maintenance-free, AGM, SLA, VRLA, as well as automotive, marine, RV, powersports, and deep-cycle batteries. Its advanced battery repair regenerator mode uses slow pulse reconditioner technology to automatically detect battery sulfation and acid stratification, restoring lost battery performance for extended battery life. It can be used and stored almost anywhere - home, garage, mobile, bench, or in car - to charge and maintain any battery - even plug in through your vehicle's 12V auxiliary cigarette lighter port. Its next-generation charging regime utilizes fast charging microprocessor technology to rapidly recharge batteries without any manual intervention. It's a completely automatic, worry-free, professional, and commercial-grade intelligent battery charger with zero overcharge. Designed to be dual purpose - both indoors and outdoors - providing weatherproof and waterproof protection from the outside elements during any time of the year, including winter. Its X-Connect battery connectors - better than SAE - allow for quick-connect permanent connection or connecting directly to the battery terminals. A digital display provides the charging status and tests diagnostics for multiple conditions such as a dead battery, bad battery, reverse polarity, and more. And it's compatible with all types of gas and diesel vehicles, including cars, automobiles, motorcycles, dirt bikes, scooters, mopeds, lawn mowers, ATVs, UTVs, lawn tractors, trailers, trucks, SUVs, boats, campers, RVs, jet skis, PWCs, wave runners, snowmobiles, 4-wheelers, generators, golf carts, classic cars, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Bentley, Maserati, Lexus, VW, Audi, Ford, Chevrolet, Corvette, Cadillac, Jeep, Prius, Toyota, Subaru, Nissan, Honda, Harley-Davidson, Suzuki, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Ducati, KTM, Indian, Husqvarna, Vespa, Polaris, Seadoo, John Deere and more."

            "When you mount a ball mount on your trailer hitch, you expect it to stay put. Whatever type of load you are hauling, having towing equipment that can work as hard as you do is a must. For all types of heavy-duty towing, CURT 5/8\" hitch pins and clips pack a little extra punch. We make our 5/8\" hitch pins out of solid steel and coat them in one of four finish options. All of these finishes offer excellent resistance to rust and corrosion for long-lasting, smooth operation. CURT hitch pins are also constructed with a 105-degree bend, creating a useful handle for a better grip and allowing the pin to stay securely engaged in the trailer hitch and ball mount. This particular 5/8\" hitch pin features a zinc finish and comes with a standard retainer hole to accept the included clip. It provides reliable installation for any ball mount or hitch-mounted accessory with a 2\" shank, making it the perfect fit for class 3, 4 and 5 trailer hitches. It also has a vinyl-coated handle on both the hitch pin and clip to allow for a better grip."

            "Meet the GENIUS5, one of our most powerful, highest-performing, energy-efficient, and compact portable universal battery chargers yet. The GENIUS5 is a 5-amp (75-watt) - 100-240VAC 50-60Hz - 6-volt and 12-volt heavy-duty battery charger, battery maintainer, trickle charger, float charger, and battery desulfator for up to 120 amp-hours. It's designed to charge and maintain all types of sealed lead-acid and lithium-ion (lifepo4) batteries, including flooded, gel, maintenance-free, AGM, SLA, VRLA, as well as automotive, marine, RV, powersports, and deep-cycle batteries. Its advanced battery repair regenerator mode uses slow pulse reconditioner technology to automatically detect battery sulfation and acid stratification, restoring lost battery performance for extended battery life. It can be used and stored almost anywhere - home, garage, mobile, bench, or in car - to charge and maintain any battery - even plug in through your vehicle's 12V auxiliary cigarette lighter port. Its next-generation charging regime utilizes fast charging microprocessor technology to rapidly recharge batteries without any manual intervention. It's a completely automatic, worry-free, professional, and commercial-grade intelligent battery charger with zero overcharge.

            "The Professional Grade Premium Silk Banded Microfiber Towel is a microfiber towel that is ideal for every job from wax and sealant removal to polishing jobs. This towel is silk banded for long lasting, safe and scratch free results. This towel is extra plush, absorbent, exceptionally soft, lint free and scratch free. The towel is constructed with a dual pile weave, one side has long fibers and the other side has short fibers. The long fiber side works great in quick details and waterless car wash applications where dirt needs to be carried away from the pain surface. The short fiber side is great for buffing away polish and wax residue and for cleaning windows. This towel is lint free and streak free. It is positively charged and will attract grease, dirt particles and dust even without the use of chemicals. The Super Plush towel is 100 percent machine washable. This towel is easy to wash using your favorite detergent. Toss it right into the washing machine for easy care. Just be sure to wash them separately from other laundry, to keep them lint free. As with all microfiber products, never expose them to fabric softener. Fabric softener will reduce their static properties and cause the microfiber to clean/spread less effectively. They can be line dried or machine dried on low setting, again, separately from other laundry."

            "Perfect for urban dwellers, those with limited access to water, or the hot rodder who just arrived at a cruise, Ultimate Waterless Wash and Wax safely lifts away dirt and grime while leaving behind a protective layer of hydrophobic wax. In as little as 15 minutes, this new formula can morph a drab and dirty appearance into a stunning, clean and shiny car, without a drop of water. What's more, depending on how dirty the car is, a single bottle, along with the help of a few microfiber towels, can wash and wax up to five average-sized cars. To use this spray, simply mist onto the surface of the vehicle and gently wipe away using a Meguiar's Supreme Shine or other high quality microfiber towel. Wash and Wax Anywhere spray's unique chemistry insures a scratch-free finish when used as directed, as special lubricants and cleaning agents safely loosen and then gently remove the dirt. Follow with a quick wipe from a clean, dry towel and the surface is left with a beautiful, glossy, just-waxed finish. Waterless Wash and Wax is also safe to use on all wheel types, plus rubber, vinyl and glass. (1) Title draft language created by generative AI and reviewed, edited, and revised by Meguiar\u2019s."

            "The Chenille Microfiber Premium Scratch Free Wash Mitt is made of thick microfiber strands that are woven into Big Fat Plump, caterpillar strands that are extremely absorbent to wash soaps and shampoo and non-abrasive to paint and finishes. The chubby spun strands hold loads of soapy water delivering a premium wash that lubricate the paint, reducing friction and enhancing paint. This mitt is easy to wash using your favorite detergent. Toss them right into the washing machine for easy care. Just be sure to wash them separately, to keep them lint free. As with all microfiber products, never expose them to fabric softener. Fabric softener will reduce their static properties and cause the microfiber to clean/spread less effectively. They can be line dried or machine dried on low setting, again, separately from other laundry."

            "In any light, day or night, the TEKTON 5941 Digital Tire Gauge gives you an instant, accurate, and easy-to-read measurement of your vehicle's tire pressure. A simple push button turns the unit on and selects one of four measurement ranges. When it\u2019s dark, the lighted nozzle illuminates your work area, so you can easily locate the valve stem. With gentle pressure, the nozzle seals onto the valve stem quickly and completely to deliver an accurate measurement. The exact measurement instantly displays on a clear, lighted digital screen, so there\u2019s no guesswork or estimation like reading an analog gauge. After you\u2019re done, a 30-second automatic shut off means you never have to worry about accidentally running the batteries dead. Contoured to fit your hand, the ergonomic shape is complemented by a soft, nonslip texture for ultimate comfort and control. Check your tire pressure often. Properly inflated tires keep you safe on the road and help you save on gas. Store this handy tool in your glove box or console, so it's always ready when you need it.",

            "The Cyclone dirt trap bucket insert sits at the bottom of your bucket while you wash filtering water non-stop. It's the filter that never stops. The Cyclone dirt trap help eliminates wash swirls and scratches with Cyclone dirt-trap filtration technology. The round wash screen separates abrasive dirt and silt from clean and soapy wash water with scores of cyclonic dirt funnels. Separating dirt from clean and soapy water keeps abrasive debris off the wash mitt, and therefore off the paintwork for a scratch-less car wash. Traditional wash baffles use large vertical screens or disposable mesh filters in an attempt to separate dirt from water, which always ends up cloudy with loose contamination and abrasive filth. These designs are defeated by the mere act of dunking the mitt into the bucket, which pushes and pulls water and dirt straight through the vertical openings of the poorly-designed screens. The Cyclone funnels of the dirt trap separate dirt through centripetal force and push it through tiny holes underneath the wash screen. The dirt remains trapped underneath the funnels and cannot easily flow back up through the tips once the mitt is pulled out from the water. The one way Cyclone filtration system is a passive filter that never needs replacing and does not rely on moving parts, no disposable filters, and requires no maintenance or energy to set up, use, or store."

            "You care about your SUV, but even if you keep it in the garage, it is still at risk all year round. Dust, pollen, paint, falling objects and even UV exposure can scratch, fade and damage your finish, diminishing the value of your vehicle. Meanwhile, cloth or canvas covers can allow condensation to accumulate. Having the right SUV cover can make the difference. Lightweight and easy to use, the Budge Lite SUV Cover is perfect for indoor storage and occasional outdoor usage against dust, dirt, and all at a budget friendly price.

            "The Gray Matter Silk Effect Super Soft Microfiber Waffle Weave Dryer Towel is a luxurious extra large, super soft waffle weave microfiber towel measuring at 36 inch by 25 inch. The towel is wrapped in a silky soft satin sewn edge which extends the life of the towel. The silk sewn edges act like a safeguard against light swirls and scratches. Inferior towels without the silk edges have a polyester edge that can easily scratch paint. This towel is designed to deliver maximum absorbency, a single towel can hold 8 9 times its weight in water. This waffle weave towel is 100 percent machine washable. This towel is easy to wash using your favorite detergent. Toss it right into the washing machine for easy care. Just be sure to wash them separately, to keep them lint free. As with all microfiber products, never expose them to fabric softener. Fabric softener will reduce their static properties and cause the microfiber to clean/spread less effectively. They can be line dried or machine dried on low setting, again, separately from other laundry."

            "Permatex Medium Strength Threadlocker Blue Formula is an all-purpose threadlocker ideal for all nut and bolt applications 6mm to 20mm. Eliminating the need for stocking expensive lock nuts and lock washers, this threadlocker locks and seals while preventing parts loosening due to vibration. It also protects threads from corrosion and is removable with hand tools for easy disassembly. Applied as a liquid or gel, threadlockers are superior to conventional lock washers, nylon inserts, and other mechanical devices because they secure the entire fastener assembly against loosening from shock and vibration by filling the space between threaded metal parts, curing to form a tough, adhesive bond and seal. They also seal the threads against leakage, preventing rust and corrosion."

For most truck and SUV owners, adding a side step is often their first modification for their truck and/or SUV. The side step is constructed from single-piece aluminum cast which is corrosion resistant, hence prolonging the life span and durability of the side steps. The frame is lightweight yet durable and does not add unnecessary load to the vehicle. It has matte finish that creates a universal appeal and provides a non-slip stepping surface. Textured and extra deep, this step can be attached to a wide range of sports trucks and SUVs by Chevrolet, Dodge RAM, Ford, GMC and Toyota.Chevrolet Avalanche 2007-2011; Avalanche 1500 2002-2006; Avalanche 2500 2002-2006; Blazer 1987-1993; C10 1975-1986; C10 Pickup 1973-1974; C10 Suburban 1976-1986; C1500 1988-1999; C1500 Suburban 1992-1999; C20 1975-1986; C20 Pickup 1973-1974; C20 Suburban 1976-1986; C2500 1988-2000; C2500 Suburban 1992-1999; C30 1975-1986; C30 Pickup 1973-1974; C35 1995-2000; C3500 1988-2000; K10 1975-1986; K10 Pickup 1973-1974; K10 Suburban 1976-1986; K1500 1988-1999; K1500 Suburban 1992-1999; K20 1975-1986; K20 Pickup 1973-1974; K20 Suburban 1976-1986; K2500 1988-2000; K2500 Suburban 1992-1999; K30 1977-1986; K30 Pickup 1973-1974; K3500 1988-2000; K5 Blazer 1976-1986; R10 Suburban 1987-1988; R1500 Suburban 1989-1991; R20 Suburban 1987-1988; R2500 Suburban 1989-1991; S10 1982-1993; Silverado 1500 a, 1999-2015; Silverado 1500 HD 2001-2006; Silverado 2500 1999-2009; Silverado 2500 HD 2001-2011; Silverado 2500HD 2012-2015; Silverado 3500 2001-2009; Silverado 3500 HD 2010; Silverado 3500HD 2011-2014; Tahoe 1995-1999; V10 Suburban 1987-1988; V1500 Suburban 1989-1991; V20 Suburban 1987-1988; V2500 Suburban 1989-1991;Dodge D100 1975-1989; D100 Pickup 1974; D150 1977-1993; D200 1975-1980; D200 Pickup 1974; D250 1981-1993; D300 1975-1980; D300 Pickup 1974; D350 1981-1993; Dakota 1997-2010; Raider 1987-1989; Ram 1500 1994-2010; Ram 2500 1994-2010; Ram 3500 1994-2009; Ramcharger 1974-1992; RD200 1978-1980; W100 1975-1989; W100 Pickup 1974; W150 1977-1993; W200 1975-1980; W200 Pickup 1974; W250 1981-1993; W300 1975; W300 Pickup 1974; W350 1981-1993;Ford Bronco 1967-1980; E-150 Econoline 1977-2002; E-150 Econoline Club Wagon 1977-2002; E-200 Econoline 1970-1974; E-250 Econoline 1977-1998; E-250 Econoline Club Wagon 1977-1991; E-300 Econoline 1970-1974; E-350 Econoline 1978-2000; E-350 Econoline Club Wagon 1978-2002; Econoline 1967; Excursion 2000-2005; Expedition 1997-2002; Explorer Expedition, Limited, Postal, Sport, XL, XL Fleet, XLS, XLT, 1991-2001; F-150 1997-2014; F-250 Super Duty 1999-2014; F-350 Super Duty 1999-2014; F-450 Super Duty 2000-2011; F-550 Super Duty 1999-2011;GMC C15 1975-1978; C15/C1500 Pickup 1972-1974; C1500 1979-1999; C25 1975-1978; C25/C2500 Pickup 1972-1974; C2500 1979-2000; C35 1975-1978; C35/C3500 Pickup 1972-1974; C3500 1979-2000; Jimmy 1976-1991; K15 1975-1978; K15/K1500 Pickup 1972-1974; K1500 1979-1999; K25 1975-1978; K25/K2500 Pickup 1972-1974; K2500 1979-2000; K35 1977-1978; K35/K3500 Pickup 1972-1974; K3500 1979-2000; Sierra 1500 1999-2015; Sierra 1500 HD 2001-2006; Sierra 2500 1999-2004; Sierra 2500 HD 2001-2011; Sierra 2500HD 2012-2015; Sierra 3500 2001-2006; Sierra 3500 HD 2010-2014; Sonoma 1991-1993;Isuzu Amigo 1991-2000; Pickup 1989-1993; Rodeo 1991-2002; Trooper 1989-2002;Mazda B2000 1983-1987; B2200 1983-1993; B2600 1987-1993; Navajo 1991-1994;Mitsubishi Mighty Max 1983-1994; Montero 1983-1999; Montero Sport 1999;Nissan 521 Pickup 1972; 620 Pickup 1972-1974; 720 1980-1986; D21 1986-1994; Frontier 1998-2009; Pathfinder 1987-2001; Pickup 1995-1997; Xterra 2005-2009;Ram 1500 2011-2015; 2500 2011-2015."

These stingers come with all necessary towing components and are pre-fitted with a factory-torqued trailer ball, eliminating the need to mount and torque your own trailer ball. This means a loaded ball mount is ready for towing right out of the package! Each one also comes with a pin and clip for mounting the ball mount into the appropriate size receiver tube. CURT offers loaded ball mounts in a variety of styles and weight ratings. This CURT loaded ball mount features a gross trailer weight capacity of 7,500 lbs. and a tongue weight capacity of 750 lbs. It comes with a 2\" trailer ball, making it an excellent choice for towing most boat trailers, utility trailers, campers, livestock trailers and recreational vehicle trailers used for hauling dirt bikes, motorcycles and ATVs (NOTE: Never exceed the lowest weight capacity of any towing component; i.e. the vehicle, hitch, trailer, etc). This ball mount also has a length of 8-1/4\", a drop of 2\" and comes with a gloss black powder coat finish to resist rust, chipping and UV damage. All CURT loaded ball mounts feature 2\" x 2\" shanks and are made with the same superior quality we put into each of our products."

            "Mr. Gasket Cataclean is a fuel and exhaust system cleaner that reduces carbon build-up and cleans your vehicle's catalytic converter, oxygen sensors, fuel injectors, and cylinder heads. Cataclean does not alter fuel composition and is safe for gasoline, diesel and hybrid engines. Testing at an independent emissions testing facility showed using Cataclean can lower your total hydrocarbon emissions by up to 50 percent (performance results are dependent on driver habits and vehicle condition). Use Cataclean to fix drivability issues such as power reduction, hesitation and hard starts, as a pre-treatment before an emissions test or to extend the life of your vehicle engine. Using Cataclean may help to avoid the replacement of costly oxygen sensors or your vehicle's catalytic converter. If you have to replace your catalytic converter, use Cataclean with the installation to extend its life. Cataclean is easy to use-simply pour in your fuel tank. Cataclean is 50 state legal and complies with VOC (including California) and OTC regulations, as well as Federal low sulphur content requirements for use in diesel motor vehicles and non-road engines. For optimum performance and protection, use Cataclean four times a year. Made in the USA."

This compact, portable device delivers jump-starting power with 700 peak amps and 350 instant starting amps. That\u2019s enough power to jump-start your car, truck, SUV, motorcycle, boat, RV, ATV, or tractor; all without the need to use another vehicle for assistance. Simply connect the clamps to the battery, turn on the switch and start your vehicle. The reverse polarity alarm will alert you when there is an improper connection. A high-powered LED light rotates 270 degrees to help you work in the dark. This jump starter is equipped with a 120 PSI air compressor to help inflate tires, sport equipment, or other items with low pressure. The built-in triple USB port comes in handy to charge your phone and electronic devices. It features an integrated charging cube (a 120V charging adapter) that allows the STANLEY FATMAX J7CS jump starter to be charged using a standard extension cord, so you don't need to keep track of a separate specific charging cable. Extension cord sold separately. For optimal performance, the unit should be charged every 30 days when not in use. Once used, the unit should be charged immediately overnight."

        "description": [
            "Avoid the mess of changing out fluids with our leak-free pump! Our LubriMatic 55-005 Fluid & Oil Transfer Pump is a simple and effective solution for adding fluids to small engines, automotive transmissions and axles, farm equipment, and industrial equipment, and is ideal for adding oil and other fluids, such as antifreeze, fuel, steering fluid, or gear lube, to small engines and marine lower units. Avoid messy spills and the hassle transferring fluids to your engine or other equipment. The LubriMatic 55-005 threads securely onto quart sized bottles and containers with traditional sized necks as commonly used for motor oil, ATF, and gear lube, however, it is not compatible with bottles that have oversize or wide-mouth necks. The LubriMatic 55-005 transfers fluid at 4cc\u2019s per stroke. Great for hard to reach places. Are you tired of wrestling with your average hand pump, trying desperately to fit it into tight spaces and awkward nooks and crannies? The LubriMatic 55-005 includes a long, 17 inch, 3/8 inch diameter flexible outlet hose that allows for easy access to hard to reach fill plugs and tubes. The stiff, rigid construction of the inlet tubes ensures that no clogs or obstructions will keep your fluids from pouring smoothly, and the inlet tubes won't curl like flexible tubes, ensuring a more complete fluid transfer. Professional quality that you can count on. For over 40 years, LubriMatic has been developing and distributing superior lubrication equipment, and we are proud to supply equipment to the industrial, hardware, marine, automotive and agricultural markets, as well as many industries requiring professional grade lubricants and penetrants."

            "Protecting the world\u2019s finest wheels and tires from theft since 1964. McGard manufactures wheel locks in the USA to meet or exceed OEM standards for safety and durability. Presently, McGard is an Original Equipment wheel lock supplier to over 30 car lines around the world. These easy-to-use, one-piece wheel locks function like regular lug nuts, but require a special key tool for installation and removal. The steel collar on the user friendly key guides the key into the lock pattern. The collar holds the key in alignment for easy installation and removal. The computer generated key designs allow for an infinite number of key patterns. The extra narrow pattern groove on the lock resists the intrusion of removal tools into the pattern. Every McGard wheel lock is fully machined from restricted chemistry steel made specifically for McGard and through-hardened for its unsurpassed level of security. McGard\u2019s plating process includes three layers of nickel and one layer of microporous chrome producing a superior finish while protecting against rust. This product may contain globally sourced materials/components.",

Its design allows for an unlimited number of different computer generated lock and key patterns. This unique wheel lock system is continually being refined and improved upon. McGard Locks are made in the United States to meet or exceed O.E.M. standards for safety and durability. Presently, McGard is an Original Equipment wheel lock supplier to over 30 car lines around the world. Compare our features and you\u2019ll see why McGard is the best wheel & tire protection available.",

            "McGard is the only manufacturer to offer 8 different key hex sizes to match the vehicle\u2019s original equipment lug wrench. Your customer will appreciate this important feature when they have to change a flat tire along the roadside.",
            "2. User Friendly Keys",
            "The Wheel Lock's steel collar guides the key into the lock pattern. Simply place the key over the lock and turn until the patterns engage. The collar holds the key in alignment for easy installation and removal.",

            "The best in the industry. Our process includes three layers of nickel and one layer of microporous chrome. The first layer of nickel is for corrosion resistance; the second layer of nickel is for luster and the third nickel layer interacts with the microporous chrome layer to disperse nature\u2019s corrosive action (rust).",

            "McGard uses only restricted chemistry steel, made in the United States, specifically for McGard. These special standards insure the structural integrity of each and every fully machined McGard wheel lock. Every lock is through-hardened and tempered, reaching the depth of hardness needed for its unsurpassed level of security (unlike case hardening which is only a surface treatment).",

            "McGard\u2019s standard for concentricity of the bearing surface to the pitch diameter is 30% more precise than OEM standards. This insures even distribution of the clamp load and uniform seating of the lock to the wheel."

            "Outstanding visibility in any weather. Rain or snow. Day or night. Bosch Aerotwin\u2019s innovative design and technological advancements provide excellent wiper performance. Bosch Aerotwin wiper blades feature customized spring strips made of high-tech, Evodium steel. These spring strips ensure consistent high pressure across the entire length of the blades, pushing the blades on to the windscreen to avoid any wet patches during operation that could inhibit your vision \u2014 and it does it all without juddering or squeaking. Combined with an aerodynamic design that reduces windage, and a blended dual rubber compound with graphite coating, Aerotwin wiper blades provide the most silent operation possible while providing a clean consistent wipe. Vehicle-specific pre-mounted, OE-equivalent adapter makes installation simple and easy - no searching for the right adapter or additional assembly necessary."

            "Traxion Tailgate Ladder is easy to install on pretty much any truck. This part will not work with Dodge RamBox, Chevrolet Avalanche and Cadilac Escalade Trucks. We do not support installation on the vehicles. It provides a nearly universal fit, deploys in a couple of seconds and greatly reduces the strain of getting into the back of a truck. When not in use the tailgate ladder folds and secures neatly against the tailgate out of the way of valuable cargo space. Heavy-duty construction ensures durability. From automotive tools that make the mechanic more safe and productive to truck accessories that improve accessibility, Traxion engineered products will continue to support the needs of their customers. Note-only half of the holes in the mounting plate will be used. Based on model of truck or tailgate the screw hole locations will vary. Optimum screw locations are the front and back sides of mounting plate instead of the interior holes. Drill six holes in optimal locations using 0.14 inch drill"

A self-regulating heating cable is ideal for water line freeze protection down to -20\u00b0F (-28\u00b0C). The hose is made with an NSF-61 certified, drinking water safe hose that does not contain BPA, phthalate, or lead. The heated drinking water hose won\u2019t leach harmful chemicals into your water or leave it tasting like plastic the way standard garden hoses do. The internal hose diameter is 5/8-inch, and the fittings are heavy-duty machined and plated for maximum corrosion deterrence. The durable exterior jacket protects the water hose and electrical components from damage or exposure. Operates on 120VAC and uses an 18AWG 6-foot power cord with LED indicator plug. CSA Low Lead Content Certified to NSF/ANSI 372 and compliant with all federal and state level Low Lead Laws."

            "Motorcraft filters are engineered to the high quality standards of the Ford Motor Company and are recommended by Ford as the original equipment replacement filter for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles. They are designed to help protect against engine wear by screening out abrasives, such as carbon, sand, dust and bits of metal before they can get into your oil. Pressure-relief valves help minimize the chance of contaminated oil circulating back into the engine and also help maintain the supply of oil to the engine under extreme cold conditions or if the filter gets clogged. The outer casings are constructed of steel, \u201cironed\u201d for a precise fit, painted to resist rust and include flutings to ease removal. The efficient filter media offers increased dirt-collecting capability and ability to capture more engine-harming particles. Silicone anti-drain back valves help prevent oil from draining out of the filter and engine when the engine is not running and resist the aging effects that an engine\u2019s high heat can cause."

            "Water spots are the mineral stains left over after a drop of water evaporates. Chemical Guys Heavy Duty Water Spot Remover uses basic chemistry to remove water spot stains and restore a spot-free shine. The specialty gel neutralizes alkaline stains with a mild acid, removing the stuck-on water stain quickly and effortlessly. If alkaline water spots are not removed quickly, the minerals can react with the paintwork and cause permanent etch marks that cannot be repaired. Heavy Duty Water Spot Remover is perfect for removing stubborn water spots from paintwork, polished metal, glass, and wheels before they can etch deep into the surface and cause irreversible damage. Use Heavy Duty Water Spot Gel to remove water stains from lawn sprinklers, rain, puddle splashes, drain and gutter drips, bad car drying methods, and more. Simply work a small amount of Water Spot Gel into the area to neutralize and melt stuck-on water spots off the surface. Rinse down the area with soap and water or detail spray, then reapply wax and sealant to protect against future water spot contamination and damage. Erase water spot stains with Chemical Guys Heavy Duty Water Spot Remover Gel."

            "The Gray Self-Centered Hex-Logic Medium Life Polishing Pad is a less dense foam formula for the application of waxes, micro-fine polishes and sealants. This pad has very light cutting power so it is perfect for pre-wax cleaners as well as many finishing polishes. This pad features PUR+ (Poly-Urethane-Reactive Bonding). This pad has the most durable and resistant backing plate, it is soft and gentle to paint. This pad also features Hexagon technology, also known as Hex-Logic. Hex-Logic pads are designed to hold product and distribute it evenly over the surface of the pad delivering a superior even finish that is hard to achieve with any other pad. The unique construction of the pads makes them extremely easy to maneuver while distributing the product evenly on the surface. The Hex-Logic pads keep the product in the groves while you start and as the pad is spun and rubbed against the surface, the polish will travel through the hex-groves into the pad, evenly delivering a superior accurate finish. The surface is constantly lubricated which reduces friction and marring. The unique hex laser cut surface of the pad enables Hex-Logic pads to conform to the shape of the surface delivering maximum surface contact. The Hexagon construction forms perfectly to a vehicle's many curves while the unique pad construction reduces unnecessary heat. The Self-Centered Pads are uniquely sized to 6.5 inches making them perfect for big or small jobs. These pads have a \"V\" like construction so the face of the pad is wider than the backing, offering a one inch foam protector that assures no matter how hard you push, you will never hit the backing of the plate against the surface."

            "Car diagnostic scanner",
            "OS601 is a cost-effective upgraded version of OBDII scanner for determining the cause of the Check Engine Light. Equips with a 2.4-inch color screen and shows live vehicle sensors data in text and graph format. Support all the 10 OBDII test modes, enhanced Mode 6, read&erase codes, code definitions and playback data from the car ECU. It enables you to inspect monitor before Smog check, and switch off the MIL.",
            "How to get started?",
            "Simply plug into the OBD2 port on your car and turn ignition on and you ready to go. No matter where you are, let this gadget accompanies with you. Let you decide if it's something you can fix or need more advanced help. Save money and time.",
            "Where's the OBDII interface?",
            "It is often under the dash, or under a panel below the handbrake in the center console.",
            "What is OBD-II?",
            "On-board diagnostics (OBD) is an automotive term referring to a vehicle's self-diagnostic and reporting capability. Vehicles produced after 1996 use OBD-II, which is a standardized system that simplifies the process a whole lot. These vehicles all use a common diagnostic connector and a set of universal trouble codes. Though only emission-related codes and data are required to be transmitted through it according to U.S. legislation, most manufacturers have made the OBD-II Data Link Connector the main connector in the vehicle through which all systems are diagnosed and reprogrammed. At the most basic level, the check engine light indicates that some sensor, somewhere in your engine, exhaust, or transmission, has provided unexpected data to computer. That could indicate a problem with the system the sensor is responsible for monitoring, a bad sensor, or even a wiring issue.",
            "Why I can't erase the fault code?",
            "Once the monitors are reset, the MIL will either remain out because the DTC was corrected by the proper repair, or it will illuminate because it has again detected the problem."

            "Protecting your vehicle while keeping it polished is essential for any car owner. Nu Finish The Once A Year Car Polish delivers a shine you\u2019ll love and also safeguards your car even after 52 automatic car washes, guaranteeing a long-lasting sheen. Unlike wax, Nu Finish Car Polish no-wax formula is easy to apply and won\u2019t break down your car\u2019s paint or finish. Forget the car buffer: This liquid polish is easy to apply and can even be used in direct sunlight. Your other vehicles are important, too. That\u2019s why Nu Finish is multipurpose and can be used on cars, fiberglass boats, RVs, and chrome surfaces. For application, first make sure your car is washed and dried. Apply Nu Finish with a damp cloth, one section at a time. Let it dry to a haze and wipe it off with a clean, soft cloth\u2026 then admire the shine. If you're looking for other simple, reliable ways to keep your car bright and polished, explore Nu Finish's line of dependable polishes and auto washes.",

            "Nu Finish Liquid Car Polish is the #1 rated car polish, as determined by leading consumer magazines, for its consistent combination of protection, durability, gloss improvement and retail value. What makes Nu Finish so effective is its wax-free formula, which makes it both easier to apply in all temperature and sun conditions and more durable.

            "Why Use a Polish Over a Conventional Wax Product",
            "Conventional waxes don't last long because the common ingredient in these products, carnauba wax, breaks down quickly in everyday conditions. Neither Nu Finish Liquid nor Nu Finish Paste Car Polish contain carnauba waxes. No other liquid or paste products can make that claim. Nu Finish is made up of a series of zinc cross-linking polymer emulsions that help it last longer than any other polish on the market. This is why Nu Finish is called \"The-Once-A-Year Car Polish.\" Give Nu Finish a try and catch how it makes water bead month after month.",
            "Additional Uses",
            "In addition to protecting your car's finish, Nu Finish works great on fiberglass boats, airplanes, motorcycles, and recreational vehicles. Nu Finish can also be used on chrome, and it works great to protect against salt spray, bird droppings, tree sap and road tar. Further, customers even report using Nu Finish on stainless steel, copper, kitchen cabinets, refrigerators, guitars, granite countertops and much more.",

            "Motorcraft filters are engineered to the high quality standards of the Ford Motor Company and are recommended by Ford as the original equipment replacement filter for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles. They are designed to help protect against engine wear by screening out abrasives, such as carbon, sand, dust and bits of metal before they can get into your oil. Pressure-relief valves help minimize the chance of contaminated oil circulating back into the engine and also help maintain the supply of oil to the engine under extreme cold conditions or if the filter gets clogged. The outer casings are constructed of steel, \u201cironed\u201d for a precise fit, painted to resist rust and include flutings to ease removal. The efficient filter media offers increased dirt-collecting capability and ability to capture more engine-harming particles. Silicone anti-drain back valves help prevent oil from draining out of the filter and engine when the engine is not running and resist the aging effects that an engine\u2019s high heat can cause."

For those who would rather push through and brave the elements, we made the winter mask for men. And trust us when we say that those sub-zero days and frigid air will have nothing on you in this cold weather thermal mask. Designed to tackle the elements \u2014 from extreme cold, sleet, and wind to harsh UV rays \u2014 our ski mask full face will fend off everything that winter throws your way, so you can get out there and do what you love, even in bone-chilling weather. An 89% polar fleece polyester and 11% spandex super soft fabric keeps your face protected from everything winter throws your way, all the while allowing moisture to escape, thanks to its quick-drying, breathable qualities. Our ninja mask has a mesh and rubber panel surrounding the nose and mouth, allowing air to travel freely in and out while keeping your face toasty warm and dry \u2014 and keeping moisture off of your goggles and glasses. Four-way stretch throughout the warm face mask ensures that it moves with you while you get outside for your favorite winter activities. Stretchy enough to fit all head sizes comfortably, and low-profile enough to be worn under your work, ski, or bike helmet, you can wear our mask as a helmet liner or on its own. Whether you\u2019re carving down the slopes, hitting the road on your motorcycle, or out walking the dog, the winter balaclava face mask has you"

            "IPELY car detailing clay bar is a synthetic plastic putty that physically pulls embedded dirt out from your car\u2019s paintwork. Foreign particles block wax from sticking to the paint, making it last for a shorter time and not shine as bright. The rough feeling on your car\u2019s exterior is pollution, industrial fallout, and environmental contamination stuck in the pores of the paintwork. Decontaminate the surface with a clay bar before putting on a new coat of wax, or polishing any exterior paintwork. Polishing with any rough contaminants grinds them deeper into the paintwork, causing more marring and scratches as they clog and destroy your expensive buffing pads. You can use the clay bar on any exterior car part that is shiny or clear. Use the clay bar to decontaminate car parts such as:Paintwork ,Glass ,Clear optical plastics ,Wheels ,Carbon fiber",
            "NOTE:",
            "There are certain parts you should not use the clay bar on, such as:Matte paintwork/vinyl wraps,Textured plastic trim,Rubber (door / window seals, tires)"

            "Meguiar\u2019s ScratchX is the perfect choice to remove light scratches, scuffs and paint transfer by hand or by dual action variable speed polisher (DA polisher). Meguiar\u2019s exclusive super micro-abrasive technology removes blemishes quickly, while advanced polymer wax protects the finish! Safe and effective on all shiny paint types and clear coats to restore a brilliant clear finish.",
            "Amazon.com",
            "ScratchX 2.0 is the must have cleaner for isolated paint problems because its micro abrasives help in the removal of fine scratches, blemishes, oxidation, light stains and surface contaminants from the vehicles paint. ScratchX 2.0 formula will not damage the paint, and will restore the brilliance and clear finish of the painted surfaces. Meguiar\u2019s ScratchX 2.0 is easy to use by hand, but may also be used with Meguiar\u2019s DA Power System or with Meguiar\u2019s Dual Action Polisher.",

            "Evaluating The Paint Surface",
            "Before applying Meguiar's ScratchX 2.0 to the vehicle, begin by washing and drying the car thoroughly, as it will allow evalutating the surface of the vehicle for the presence of various defects needing correction.Defects fall into two basic categories: above surface bonded contaminants (industrial fall out, paint overspray, tree sap mist, and bird droppings) and below surface defects (fine scratches, swirl marks, etching, and oxidation). Above surface bonded contaminants often cannot be seen but they can be felt. Run a clean hand over the paint of the vehicle immediately after washing and drying it. Does the paint feel \"as smooth as glass\"? If the paint surface is rough to the touch, this is an indication to clay the car using Meguiar\u2019s Smooth Surface Clay Kit first. Below surface defects generally cannot be felt, but they can be seen, especially in strong, direct light.",
            "Good lighting is critical to evaluating the surface of the paint, because most cars will look good in the shade; therefore inspect the car's finish in direct sunlight or under strong fluorescent lights. Cobweb or spider web swirls come primarily from the washing and drying process when poor technique or tools are used; for example, the use of old towels, dishwashing detergents, and coarse sponges. Holograms however, are a specific type of defect caused by the improper use of a high speed rotary buffer. These types of defects not only mar the finish but reduce the paint\u2019s ability to reflect light clearly and cleanly, making the paint appear dull, faded and \u201cwashed out\u201d. Removing below surface defects like light scratches, swirls, oxidation and bird dropping etching restores the clarity and reflectivity of the paint, making colors more vibrant and reflections more brilliant.",
            "Use to remove light to moderate scratching and swirling",
            "A Few Tips About Applying ScratchX 2.0",
            "Liquid paint cleaners should be applied to small areas at a time, no larger than one square foot when working by hand or two square feet when working with a dual action polisher such as the Meguiar's DA Power System or Meguiar's Dual Action Polisher. Working small areas at a time is crucial in order to concentrate the work rather than spreading it out over a too large of an area. Keep the following points in mind when working with any \u201cpaint cleaner\u201d like Meguiar's ScratchX: Paint cleaners do not need to dry before removing and in fact should be wiped off immediately after they're worked over the finish. Paint cleaners need to be worked into the finish; they are not wipe on, wipe off products. Deep defects (scratches) that go through the clear coat cannot be corrected without repainting or applying touch up paint. The harder the paint and the deeper the defect, the smaller the area to work at one time. Paint cleaners remove everything off the surface of the paint including wax, so after using paint cleaner re-apply a protective coating of wax.",

            "Bracketless is the new shape of wiper blade technology. As the name implies, bracketless wiper blades, also known as beam or flat blades, are designed without the metal or plastic brackets, joints or hinges of conventional wiper blades, so snow and ice have nowhere to build up. Bosch Evolution Wiper Blades feature a patented beam technology that applies more uniform wiper arm pressure along the entire length of the blade for virtually streak-free wiping performance. The exclusive, blended rubber delivers clean, quiet performance and exceptional all-weather visibility. An aerodynamic, symmetrical wind spoiler holds the blade securely to the windshield for a consistently clear wipe. Versatile double locking connector offers quick, easy, and secure installation on many popular wiper arm types (Hook, Pin, Side Lock, 16mm Narrow Top Lock, 19mm Large Top Lock, Pinch Tab) \u2013 with no additional adapters required. Replace your conventional wiper blades with Bosch Evolution and see if you don't agree that bracketless is better."

        "description": [
            "The Tekonsha Primus IQ electric trailer brake controller gives you dependable braking power in a compact design. As an industry staple for more than ten years, this proportional braking system provides a smooth braking response in any stopping situation. With its petite yet durable exterior, this trailer brake controller fits nicely under the dash, making it easily accessible from the driver\u2019s seat without being in the way. While also compact, the brains of the Primus IQ are astute. This insightful brake controller has an easy-to-read LED display, self-diagnostic check to monitor your connection and trailer braking activity, and is self-leveling when mounted within a 90-degree vertical range, so there\u2019s no need to adjust the unit once it\u2019s installed. It also features a power output knob to quickly and easily set your desired braking power, a boost option that lets you apply up to three levels of additional trailer braking power, especially when hauling heavier loads, and manual override. The Primus IQ was created to work with electric over hydraulic braking systems, works proportionally in reverse to make backing into tough spots a bit easier, and - like the Prodigy P3, Prodigy P2, and many other Tekonsha brake controllers \u2013 utilizes primary sensor technology to ensure the smoothest stop possible. When you\u2019re done towing, the IQ\u2019s snap-in dash mounting clip, Plug & Play port for two plug adapters, and removeable electrical connector allow the unit to be quickly stored. The Primus IQ is truly a complete trailer brake controller kit. It works with trailers with 1-3 axles, comes with all necessary mounting hardware, and is backed by a limited lifetime warranty."

            "Camco's ready-to-use RhinoFLEX 15\u2019 Camper Sewer Hose Kit has everything you need for simple dumping at campground dump stations. The 23-mil hose is made of ultra-tough polyolefin that is reinforced with steel wire. It\u2019s the toughest sewer hose you can buy. The hose is collapsible and maintains its shape, so you only have to extend as much hose as needed (without worrying about excess length). This kit includes: (1) RhinoFLEX 15\u2019 RV sewage hose, (1) swivel bayonet fitting, (1) transparent elbow fitting with 4-in-1 adapter, and (2) storage caps for each end of the RV waste hose. The pre-attached swivel bayonet fitting features four prongs for a more secure fit. While at the dump-station, the clear elbow with 4-in-1 adapter allows you to connect to a 3\u2033 slip or a 3\u2033, 3 1/2\u2033, or 4\u2033 NPT threaded sewer connection. The hose and fittings compress to 56\u2033 (4 5/8\u2019) for convenient storage. Once the 4-in-1 adapter is removed, you can store the hose in standard 4\u2033 square bumpers. This Camco sewer hose kit is an essential item to include in your RV supplies."
