            "Originally released in 1984, Bob Marley's LEGEND illustrates the remarkable life and recording career of one of reggae music's most important figures. This iconic collection not only serves as the perfect introduction to the music of Bob Marley, it has become an essential part in every Marley collection. It remains the world's best-selling reggae album and continues to be one of the best-selling catalog albums, exceeding 15 copies in the U.S. alone and over 27 million worldwide. Coupled with the original release of LEGEND on CD, this deluxe version features this iconic collection entirely mixed in 5.1 by the GRAMMY\u00ae Award winning producer Bob Clearmountain on Blu-Ray Pure Audio Disc\u2122 and now includes the original, early studio version of 'No Woman No Cry,' in lieu of the previous live version. Also featured are two, previously unheard alternate takes of 'Easy Skanking' and 'Punky Reggae Party' recently discovered in the Marley vault. Classic Marley anthems include 'Three Little Birds,' 'Get Up Stand Up,' 'One Love/People Get Ready,' 'No Woman No Cry' and 'I Shot The Sheriff,' which was later a No. 1 hit for Eric Clapton, as well as 'Jamming,' 'Exodus,' 'Redemption Song' and 'Is This Love.'PACKAGINGBoth the CD and Blu-Ray Pure Audio Disc\u2122 are housed in a 28-page, case bound book featuring extended liner notes, unseen photos and forewards written by Sir Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder, and liner notes by author of the book Marley, Christopher Farley."

            "Island 50th Anniversary Special Edition. There are few musicians whose music has indisputably advanced humanity. Reggae figurehead Bob Marley--a songwriter, poet, activist, and visionary--is one of them. The idea that a single-disc collection could represent the depth, breadth, and power of Marley's achievement is far-fetched, but LEGEND makes an excellent attempt. Every single one of its tracks is outstanding, and the artist's different faces--revolutionary (\"Get Up Stand Up\"), romantic (\"Is This Love\"), devout Rastafarian (\"Buffalo Soldier\"), and prophet (\"One Love/People Get Ready\") are equally represented.In addition to his moving message of love and unity, Marley is a master songwriter, as the timelessness of songs like \"Stir It Up,\" \"I Shot the Sheriff,\" and the gorgeous, poignant \"Redemption Song\" proves. Of course, a true sampling of Marley's output would require some early ska material, the Wailer's debut (CATCH A FIRE), the definitive NATTY DREAD, and his later-period opus EXODUS, but LEGEND provides a highly satisfying, if brief, overview of Marley's genius. A record well suited to any location, season, or time of day, it has proven universal in its appeal. The music herein is as essential as air. (Note: The Deluxe Edition CD includes two bonus tracks and an additional disc of remixes)."

            "21 is the eagerly awaited sophomore album from British singer-songwriter Adele. Its the follow up to Adele s critically acclaimed, Grammy award winning debut album 19 (both named after her age at the time the songs were written). Recorded in Malibu and London, 21 offered Adele the opportunity to work with such luminary producers and songwriters as Rick Rubin, Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Dan Wilson and Fraser T. Smith, as well as continuing to work with Francis Eg White and Jim Abbiss. This new collection of songs showcases the growth of this incredible artist, who at the very young age of twenty two, exhibits the poise of a seasoned veteran. Adele s music takes some new direction while staying true to her signature style. I discovered lots of artists I'd never heard of, particularly Wanda Jackson, Allison Krauss, Yvonne Fair, Andrew Bird, Neko Case, Lady Antebellum and Steel Drivers who I fell in love with. Then I delved in to more from artists I've loved forever - Mary J. Blige, Kanye West, Elbow, Mos Def, Alanis Morissette, Tom Waits and Sinead O'Connor.

            "Import vinyl LP. Nobody could predict the global sensation Adele was about to unleash when rolling out \"21\" in 2011. Certainly, her album \"19\" was a huge success, but \"21\" became a juggernaut of mega hits including \"Rolling in the Deep;\" \"Rumour Has It;\" \"Set Fire to the Rain\" and \"Someone Like You.\" There are only 11 songs on the album, and 9 of them charted. The album didn't just peak at #1, it went into orbit. Although it was produced by the legendary Rick Rubins, it is Adele's remarkable vocal range and power with such a soulful warmth that carries the whole album. More than a singer, Adele also co-wrote nearly the entire album with assists from Paul Epworth, Francis White, Dan Wilson and Ryan Tedder, among others. Clearly \"21\" has a cross-generational appeal, especially with it's heavy soul influences, but it also seems to announce the arrival of the millennials as a generational force on the music industry. This is the UK LP pressing by the British-born star."

            "Chris Stapleton s Traveller to Be Released This SpringBy JON CARAMANICAFEB. 20, 2015At the 2013 CMA Awards, Luke Bryan performed Drink a Beer, probably the most melancholic number of his brawn-and-booze career. He sat on a stool, surrounded by smoke, in a noncommittal T-shirt and jeans and sang about losing a loved one with a tender, lovely flutter in his voice. He seemed like a man in pain. You wanted to give him a hug.Just before the first chorus, the camera panned back, revealing a man in a weathered leather cowboy hat and full, thick, long beard hovering in the background. Mr. Bryan began to set the table for the song s emotional reckoning: Don t feel like going home/So I m gonna ... And then came the ghost in the rear, singing in devastating harmony with Mr. Bryan loud to his soft, agitated to his wounded, twangy to his clean, scratchy to his smooth: ... sit right here/on the edge of this pier/and watch the sunset disappear. If you listened to Mr. Bryan sing that part alone, you d think that was a sad, lonely act. But listen to his background singer alone, and it would sound searching, frenzied, almost frightened.That was Chris Stapleton singing behind Mr. Bryan. Mr. Stapleton was one of the writers of that song, along with other songs that cut to the emotional quick sung by Josh Turner ( Your Man ), Darius Rucker ( Come Back Song ), Kenny Chesney ( Never Wanted Nothing More ) and more.And Mr. Stapleton has, for years, been a voice in search of a spotlight. Once the frontman of the bluegrass band the SteelDrivers Adele covered a SteelDrivers track, If It Hadn t Been For Love Mr. Stapleton has put in work in a rock band, the Jompson Brothers, and plenty of time in Nashville songwriting rooms.Now it s his turn. After a false start with What Are You Listening To?, a debut single that fizzled, Mr. Stapleton is arriving this spring (May 5) with his debut solo album, Traveller (Mercury Nashville). On this howling, earthy, spacious album, Mr. Stapleton s voice is liquor-thick and three-drinks limber. That s not the modern country model of manliness, which is preening and glossy, but a reminder of the genre s haggard strain that long predates it. --NY Times"

You wanted to give him a hug.Just before the first chorus, the camera panned back, revealing a man in a weathered leather cowboy hat and full, thick, long beard hovering in the background. Mr. Bryan began to set the table for the song s emotional reckoning: Don t feel like going home/So I m gonna ... And then came the ghost in the rear, singing in devastating harmony with Mr. Bryan loud to his soft, agitated to his wounded, twangy to his clean, scratchy to his smooth: ... sit right here/on the edge of this pier/and watch the sunset disappear. If you listened to Mr. Bryan sing that part alone, you d think that was a sad, lonely act. But listen to his background singer alone, and it would sound searching, frenzied, almost frightened.That was Chris Stapleton singing behind Mr. Bryan. Mr. Stapleton was one of the writers of that song, along with other songs that cut to the emotional quick sung by Josh Turner ( Your Man ), Darius Rucker ( Come Back Song ), Kenny Chesney ( Never Wanted Nothing More ) and more.And Mr. Stapleton has, for years, been a voice in search of a spotlight. Once the frontman of the bluegrass band the SteelDrivers Adele covered a SteelDrivers track, If It Hadn t Been For Love Mr. Stapleton has put in work in a rock band, the Jompson Brothers, and plenty of time in Nashville songwriting rooms.Now it s his turn. After a false start with What Are You Listening To?, a debut single that fizzled, Mr. Stapleton is arriving this spring (May 5) with his debut solo album, Traveller (Mercury Nashville). On this howling, earthy, spacious album, Mr. Stapleton s voice is liquor-thick and three-drinks limber. That s not the modern country model of manliness, which is preening and glossy, but a reminder of the genre s haggard strain that long predates it. --NY Times"

With this release, The Beatles' first four albums make their North American stereo vinyl debuts",
            "There has always been demand for The Beatles' albums on vinyl. Indeed, 2011's best-selling vinyl LP in the United States was Abbey Road. Following the success of The Beatles' acclaimed, GRAMMY Award-winning 2009 CD remasters, it was decided that the sound experts at EMI's Abbey Road Studios should create new versions of The Beatles' vinyl LPs. The project demanded the same meticulous approach taken for the CD releases, and the brief was a simple one: cut the digital remasters to vinyl with an absolute minimum of compromise to the sound. However, the process involved to do that was far from simple",
            "The first stage in transferring the sound of a master recording to vinyl is the creation of a disc to be used during vinyl manufacture. There were two options to consider. A Direct Metal Master (DMM), developed in the late seventies, allows sound to be cut directly into a stainless steel disc coated with a hard copper alloy. The older, alternative method is to cut the sound into the soft lacquer coating on a nickel disc - the first of several steps leading to the production of a stamper to press the vinyl",
            "A 'blind' listening test was arranged to choose between a 'lacquer' or 'copper' cut. Using both methods, A Hard Day's Night was pressed with ten seconds of silence at the beginning and end of each side. This allowed not only the reproduction of the music to be assessed, but also the noise made by the vinyl itself. After much discussion, two factors swung the decision towards using the lacquer process. First, it was judged to create a warmer sound than a DMM. Secondly, there was a practical advantage of having 'blank' discs of a consistent quality when cutting lacquers",
            "The next step was to use the Neumann VMS80 cutting lathe at Abbey Road. Following thorough mechanical and electrical tests to ensure it was operating in peak condition, engineer Sean Magee cut the LPs in chronological release order. He used the original 24-bit remasters rather than the 16-bit versions that were required for CD production. It was also decided to use the remasters that had not undergone 'limiting' - a procedure to increase the sound level, which is deemed necessary for most current pop CDs",
            "Having made initial test cuts, Magee pinpointed any sound problems that can occur during playback of vinyl records. To rectify them, changes were made to the remasters with a Digital Audio Workstation. For example, each vinyl album was listened to for any 'sibilant episodes' - vocal distortion that can occur on consonant sounds such as S and T. These were corrected by reducing the level in the very small portion of sound causing the undesired effect. Similarly, any likelihood of 'inner-groove distortion' was addressed. As the stylus approaches the centre of the record, it is liable to track the groove less accurately. This can affect the high-middle frequencies, producing a 'mushy' sound particularly noticeable on vocals. Using what Magee has described as 'surgical EQ,' problem frequencies were identified and reduced in level to compensate for this",
            "The last phase of the vinyl mastering process began with the arrival of the first batches of test pressings made from master lacquers that had been sent to the two pressing plant factories. Stringent quality tests identified any noise or click appearing on more than one test pressing in the same place. If this happened, it was clear that the undesired sounds had been introduced either during the cutting or the pressing stage and so the test records were rejected. In the quest to achieve the highest quality possible, the Abbey Road team worked closely with the pressing factories and the manufacturers of the lacquer and cutting styli",
            "An additional and unusual challenge was to ensure the proper playback of the sounds embedded in the 'lock-groove' at the end of side two of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Requiring a combination of good timing and luck, it had always been a lengthy and costly process to make it work properly. In fact, it was so tricky, it had never been attempted for American pressings of the LP. Naturally, Sean Magee and the team perfected this and the garbled message is heard as originally intended on the remastered Sgt. Pepper LP."

The \"HAMILTON (ORIGINAL BROADWAY CAST RECORDING)\" is executive produced by Ahmir \"Questlove\" Thompson and Tariq \"Black Thought\" Trotter, founding members of the Grammy Award winning hip-hop band, The Roots. \"HAMILTON\" has book, music and lyrics by Tony and Grammy Award-winning composer Lin Manuel Miranda, who also plays the title role. The musical is directed by Thomas Kail, with choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler and music direction and orchestrations by Alex Lacamoire. \"HAMILTON\" is inspired by Ron Chernow's biography \"Alexander Hamilton\"."

Though all four contribute to the first side's writing, John Lennon's hard-rocking, \"Come Together\" and \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" make the strongest impression. A series of song fragments edited together in suite form dominates side two; its portentous, touching, official close (\"Golden Slumbers\"/\"Carry That Weight\"/\"The End\") is nicely undercut, in typical Beatles fashion, by Paul McCartney's cheeky \"Her Majesty,\" which follows.",

            "\u2018=\u2019 - the fourth instalment in Sheeran\u2019s symbol album series \u2013 is Ed\u2019s most accomplished work yet; the evolution of an artist who continues to tread new ground. A body of songs that were made over a four-year period following his seminal \u2018\u00f7\u2019 (Divide) album era, thematically, \u2018=\u2019 finds Ed taking stock of his life and the people in it, as he explores the varying degrees of love (\u2018The Joker And The Queen\u2019, \u2018First Times\u2019, \u20182step'), loss (\u2018Visiting Hours\u2019), resilience (\u2018Can\u2019t Stop The Rain\u2019) and fatherhood (\u2018Sandman\u2019, \u2018Leave Your Life\u2019), while also processing his reality and career (\u2018Tides\u2019). Sonically, \u2018=\u2019 encapsulates Ed\u2019s versatile musical palette, spanning signature, guitar-led tracks and world-class balladry to weightier, euphoric production moments, as first showcased on the album\u2019s lead single \u2018Bad Habits,\u2019 released earlier this summer.",
            "= seamlessly captures both the intimate and every day; elevating universal experiences to a higher plane as reflected by \u2018Visiting Hours\u2019 \u2013 a track that finds Ed coming to terms with the loss of his mentor and friend, Michael Gudinski, and written shortly after his passing: \u201cI wish that heaven had visiting hours / So I can just swing by and ask your advice\u201d. Performed for the first time at Michael\u2019s State Memorial in March, the poignant track, which is joined by a stripped performance video, features backing vocals from Michael\u2019s close friends, Kylie Minogue and Jimmy Barnes.",
            "Written and recorded across Suffolk, London, Sweden and LA, the album\u2019s executive production comes from Ed Sheeran, FRED (No.6 Collaborations Project) and Johnny McDaid (Divide), with additional writing and/or production provided by Steve Mac, Joe Rubel, Amy Wadge, Foy Vance, Elvira Anderfjard, David Hodges, Andrew Watt, Lou Bell, Natalie Hemby and Ben Kweller. Sheeran\u2019s brother, Matthew, a composer, also contributes stunning string arrangements on \u2018First Times\u2019 and \u2018The Joker And The Queen\u2019. The album artwork is a vivid collage of butterfly imagery symbolizing the albums\u2019 thread of \u2018new life\u2019 and is backdropped by one of Ed\u2019s own abstract paintings."

            "\u2018=\u2019 - the fourth instalment in Sheeran\u2019s symbol album series \u2013 is Ed\u2019s most accomplished work yet; the evolution of an artist who continues to tread new ground. A body of songs that were made over a four-year period following his seminal \u2018\u00f7\u2019 (Divide) album era, thematically, \u2018=\u2019 finds Ed taking stock of his life and the people in it, as he explores the varying degrees of love (\u2018The Joker And The Queen\u2019, \u2018First Times\u2019, \u20182step'), loss (\u2018Visiting Hours\u2019), resilience (\u2018Can\u2019t Stop The Rain\u2019) and fatherhood (\u2018Sandman\u2019, \u2018Leave Your Life\u2019), while also processing his reality and career (\u2018Tides\u2019). Sonically, \u2018=\u2019 encapsulates Ed\u2019s versatile musical palette, spanning signature, guitar-led tracks and world-class balladry to weightier, euphoric production moments, as first showcased on the album\u2019s lead single \u2018Bad Habits,\u2019 released earlier this summer.\"=\" seamlessly captures both the intimate and every day; elevating universal experiences to a higher plane as reflected by \u2018Visiting Hours\u2019 \u2013 a track that finds Ed coming to terms with the loss of his mentor and friend, Michael Gudinski, and written shortly after his passing: \u201cI wish that heaven had visiting hours / So I can just swing by and ask your advice\u201d. Performed for the first time at Michael\u2019s State Memorial in March, the poignant track, which is joined by a stripped performance video, features backing vocals from Michael\u2019s close friends, Kylie Minogue and Jimmy Barnes.Written and recorded across Suffolk, London, Sweden and LA, the album\u2019s executive production comes from Ed Sheeran, FRED (No.6 Collaborations Project) and Johnny McDaid (Divide), with additional writing and/or production provided by Steve Mac, Joe Rubel, Amy Wadge, Foy Vance, Elvira Anderfjard, David Hodges, Andrew Watt, Lou Bell, Natalie Hemby and Ben Kweller. Sheeran\u2019s brother, Matthew, a composer, also contributes stunning string arrangements on \u2018First Times\u2019 and \u2018The Joker And The Queen\u2019. The album artwork is a vivid collage of butterfly imagery symbolizing the albums\u2019 thread of \u2018new life\u2019 and is backdropped by one of Ed\u2019s own abstract paintings."

Rising to #1 and ultimately selling over 30 million copies worldwide, Nevermind would come to be much more than one of the most successful and influential albums of the Rock era. Now on the occasion of Nevermind's 20th anniversary, Universal presents a full spectrum re-release worthy of such a pivotal classic."

            "Official reissue of Fleetwood Mac's Rumours pressed up on virgin audiophile vinyl. Not the rarest record by any means (it is after all the second biggest-selling record of all time), but still heavily sweated amongst djs, collectors, and music lovers alike for good reason. This is the one with all hits - \"Dreams(1),\" \"Don't Stop(2),\" \"Go Your Own Way(3),\" \"You Make Loving Fun(4),\" \"The Chain(5),\" etc. Stevie Nicks and company were at the top of their game with this one making it the top album of 1977 (catching a Grammy for best album and Diamond award from R.I.A.A.). Classic and essential."

This is the one with all hits - \"Dreams(1),\" \"Don't Stop(2),\" \"Go Your Own Way(3),\" \"You Make Loving Fun(4),\" \"The Chain(5),\" etc. Stevie Nicks and company were at the top of their game with this one making it the top album of 1977 (catching a Grammy for best album and Diamond award from R.I.A.A.).

            "established itself as one of rock's most ubiquitous, overarching successes, discussing Fleetwood Mac's heady 1977 monster (18 million sold and counting) might seem pointless; one might as well deconstruct a Big Mac. But this remastered, double-disc deluxe edition succeeds by offering up a generous, compelling portrait of that overly familiar musical triumph via 18 bonus tracks that include demos, outtakes, run-throughs, and studio jams. Stripping hits like \"Don't Stop,\" \"Go Your Own Way\" and \"Gold Dust Woman\" down to their most bare-bones form reveals the sturdy, elemental framework that tellingly lies beneath all the pop perfection. But tracks like Lindsey Buckingham's ebullient instrumental \"Brushes\" (the basic tracks of \"Never Going Back Again\") also display a musician whose focused vision is informed by accomplished playing that's anything but simple. The two brief studio jams included aren't much more than noisy, disposable fun. But other outtakes of songs that didn't make the album (Stevie Nicks's \"Think About It\" and \"Planets of the Universe\"; Buckingham's \"Doesn't Anything Last\") help underscore the contention of Dave DiMartino's insightful new liner notes: This was a band on the cusp of triumph literally coming apart at its emotional seams, yet one which somehow channeled that personal turmoil into nothing short of epochal musical success.",

Released in July, 1980, Back in Black was the first AC/DC album recorded without former lead singer Bon Scott, who died in February of that year. Back in Black was the first album to feature vocalist Brian Johnson, formerly of Geordie.

            "is less a collection of songs than a single work, which is sometimes frustrating; the plot lacks enough coherence to hold the snippets of music together. However, there are occasional flashes of brilliance on what ranks as Pink Floyd's most ambitious project. Most of these come from the fully developed songs, which have become classics in their own right. \"Hey You,\" \"Mother,\" and especially \"Comfortably Numb\" are subtle, incredible pieces of music. Though complex, they move at a relaxed pace, allowing the listener to absorb them slowly; this kind of pacing was something Pink Floyd excelled at. Also worth noting is the \"Another Brick in the Wall/The Happiest Days of Our Lives\" medley, which has become a staple of rock radio.",

            "Limited double 180 gram vinyl LP pressing in gatefold jacket. Remastered from the original analogue tapes by James Guthrie, Joel Plante, and Bernie Grundman. The Wall is the 11th studio album by Pink Floyd, originally released in November 1979. It is the last studio album released with the line-up of guitarist David Gilmour, bass guitarist/lyricist Roger Waters, keyboardist Richard Wright, and drummer Nick Mason before Wright left the band. As with Pink Floyd's prior three albums, The Wall is a concept album, exploring themes of abandonment and personal isolation. It is a rock opera that follows Pink, a character whom Waters modelled after himself and the band's original leader, Syd Barrett. Waters conceived the album during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration with the audience became so acute that he imagined a wall between the audience and the stage. The album was one of the best-selling of 1980, and by 1999 it had sold over 23 million RIAA-certified units, making it the third highest certified album in the United States."

            "The Beatles' acclaimed original studio album remasters, released on CD in 2009, make their long-awaited stereo vinyl debut",
            "Manufactured on 180-gram, audiophile quality vinyl with replicated artwork, the 14 albums return to their original glory with details including the poster in The Beatles (The White Album), the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band's cut-outs, and special inner bags for some of the titles",
            "The titles include The Beatles' 12 original UK albums, first released between 1963 and 1970, the US-originated Magical Mystery Tour, now part of the group's core catalogue, and Past Masters, Volumes One & Two, first released individually in 1988, featuring non-album A-sides and B-sides, EP tracks and rarities. With this release, The Beatles' first four albums make their North American stereo vinyl debuts",
            "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band packaging includes replica psychedelic inner sleeve, cardboard cutout sheet and additional insert",
            "There has always been demand for The Beatles' albums on vinyl. Indeed, 2011's best-selling vinyl LP in the United States was Abbey Road. Following the success of The Beatles' acclaimed, GRAMMY Award-winning 2009 CD remasters, it was decided that the sound experts at EMI's Abbey Road Studios should create new versions of The Beatles' vinyl LPs. The project demanded the same meticulous approach taken for the CD releases, and the brief was a simple one: cut the digital remasters to vinyl with an absolute minimum of compromise to the sound. However, the process involved to do that was far from simple",
            "The first stage in transferring the sound of a master recording to vinyl is the creation of a disc to be used during vinyl manufacture. There were two options to consider. A Direct Metal Master (DMM), developed in the late seventies, allows sound to be cut directly into a stainless steel disc coated with a hard copper alloy. The older, alternative method is to cut the sound into the soft lacquer coating on a nickel disc - the first of several steps leading to the production of a stamper to press the vinyl",
            "A 'blind' listening test was arranged to choose between a 'lacquer' or 'copper' cut. Using both methods, A Hard Day's Night was pressed with ten seconds of silence at the beginning and end of each side. This allowed not only the reproduction of the music to be assessed, but also the noise made by the vinyl itself. After much discussion, two factors swung the decision towards using the lacquer process. First, it was judged to create a warmer sound than a DMM. Secondly, there was a practical advantage of having 'blank' discs of a consistent quality when cutting lacquers",
            "The next step was to use the Neumann VMS80 cutting lathe at Abbey Road. Following thorough mechanical and electrical tests to ensure it was operating in peak condition, engineer Sean Magee cut the LPs in chronological release order. He used the original 24-bit remasters rather than the 16-bit versions that were required for CD production. It was also decided to use the remasters that had not undergone 'limiting' - a procedure to increase the sound level, which is deemed necessary for most current pop CDs",
            "Having made initial test cuts, Magee pinpointed any sound problems that can occur during playback of vinyl records. To rectify them, changes were made to the remasters with a Digital Audio Workstation. For example, each vinyl album was listened to for any 'sibilant episodes' - vocal distortion that can occur on consonant sounds such as S and T. These were corrected by reducing the level in the very small portion of sound causing the undesired effect. Similarly, any likelihood of 'inner-groove distortion' was addressed. As the stylus approaches the centre of the record, it is liable to track the groove less accurately. This can affect the high-middle frequencies, producing a 'mushy' sound particularly noticeable on vocals. Using what Magee has described as 'surgical EQ,' problem frequencies were identified and reduced in level to compensate for this",
            "The last phase of the vinyl mastering process began with the arrival of the first batches of test pressings made from master lacquers that had been sent to the two pressing plant factories. Stringent quality tests identified any noise or click appearing on more than one test pressing in the same place. If this happened, it was clear that the undesired sounds had been introduced either during the cutting or the pressing stage and so the test records were rejected. In the quest to achieve the highest quality possible, the Abbey Road team worked closely with the pressing factories and the manufacturers of the lacquer and cutting styli",
            "An additional and unusual challenge was to ensure the proper playback of the sounds embedded in the 'lock-groove' at the end of side two of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Requiring a combination of good timing and luck, it had always been a lengthy and costly process to make it work properly. In fact, it was so tricky, it had never been attempted for American pressings of the LP. Naturally, Sean Magee and the team perfected this and the garbled message is heard as originally intended on the remastered Sgt. Pepper LP."

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, a groundbreaking masterwork that became popular music's most universallyacclaimed album. The album is newly mixed by Giles Martin and engineer Sam Okell in stereo, sourced directly from the four-track masters at Abbey Road Studios in London, and guided by the original, Beatles-preferred mono mix produced by his father, George Martin.This expanded 180-gram 2LP vinyl gatefold package features the new stereo album mix on the first LP and adds a second LP with previously unreleased alternate takes for each of the album's 13 songs, newly mixed in stereo and sequenced in the same order as the album."

            "2011 remaster. The Wall is the 11th studio album by Pink Floyd, originally released in November 1979. It is the last studio album released with the line-up of guitarist David Gilmour, bass guitarist/lyricist Roger Waters, keyboardist Richard Wright, and drummer Nick Mason before Wright left the band. As with Pink Floyd's prior three albums, The Wall is a concept album, exploring themes of abandonment and personal isolation. It is a rock opera that follows Pink, a character whom Waters modelled after himself and the band's original leader, Syd Barrett. Waters conceived the album during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration with the audience became so acute that he imagined a wall between the audience and the stage. The album was one of the best-selling of 1980, and by 1999 it had sold over 23 million RIAA-certified units, making it the third highest certified album in the United States.  Tracklist  Disc 1:  1. In the Flesh?  2. The Thin Ice  3. Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 1  4. The Happiest Days of Our Lives  5. Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2  6. Mother  7. Goodbye Blue Sky  8. Empty Spaces  9. Young Lust  10. One of My Turns  11. Don't Leave Me Now  12. Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 3  13. Goodbye Cruel World  Disc 2:  1. Hey You  2. Is There Anybody Out There?  3. Nobody Home  4.

            "The Beatles in mono: This is how most listeners first heard the group in the 1960s, when mono was the predominant audio format. Up until 1968, each Beatles album was given a unique mono and stereo mix, but the group always regarded the mono as primary. SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND is released in mono on 180-gram vinyl with faithfully replicated artwork, newly mastered from the analogue master tapes. In an audiophile-minded undertaking, The Beatles' acclaimed mono albums have been newly mastered for vinyl from quarter-inch master tapes at Abbey Road Studios by GRAMMY\u00ae-winning engineer Sean Magee and GRAMMY\u00ae-winning mastering supervisor Steve Berkowitz. While THE BEATLES IN MONO CD boxed set released in 2009 was created from digital remasters, for this new vinyl project, Magee and Berkowitz cut the records without using any digital technology. Instead, they employed the same procedures used in the 1960s, guided by the original albums and by detailed transfer notes made by the original cutting engineers. Working in the same room at Abbey Road where most of The Beatles' albums were initially cut, the pair first dedicated weeks to concentrated listening, fastidiously comparing the master tapes with first pressings of the mono records made in the 1960s. Using a rigorously tested Studer A80 machine to play back the precious tapes, the new vinyl was cut on a 1980s-era VMS80 lathe. Manufactured for the world at Optimal Media in Germany, The Beatles' albums are presented in their original glory, both sonically and in their packaging."

            "PINK FLOYD / DARK SIDE OF MOON - Vinyl LP. The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth album by the English rock band Pink Floyd. Originally released on 1 March 1973, on the label Harvest, it built on ideas explored in the band's earlier recordings and live shows, but departs from instrumental thematic by founding member Syd Barrett. The album explores themes including conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state. - Developed during live performances, an early version was premiered several months before recording began; new material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road in London. The group used some advanced recording techniques at the time, including multitrack recording and tape loops. Analogue synthesizers were prominent in several tracks, and snippets from recorded interviews with Pink Floyd's road crew and others provided philosophical quotations throughout. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many distinctively notable sonic aspects and the recruitment of non-lexical singer Clare Torry. The album's iconic sleeve, designed by Storm Thorgerson, depicts a prism dispersing light into colour and represents the band's lighting, the record's thematic material, and keyboardist Richard Wright's \"simple and bold\" design request. \u2022Stereo remastered album on heavyweight 180g vinyl \u2022Original UK release date: March 1973 \u2022Certified 15 times platinum in the US and 14 times platinum in the UK \u2022Reached number one in the UK and the US \u2022Topped Billboard Top LPs and Tapes and charted for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988 \u2022Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the best selling worldwide 2016 version Remastered from the original analogue tapes by James Guthrie, Joel Plante, and Bernie Grundman."

            "Ed Sheeran",
            "One of the most anticipated global releases of 2017, \"\u00f7\" sees the 25-year-old in his finest form yet. Drawing inspiration from a wide array of experiences and subjects, Sheeran takes you through a hugely personal journey; be that reflecting on past relationships, family memories, his musical career or his time off travelling the world in 2016. Musically, \u00f7 is a varied collection of beautifully orchestrated and emotive ballads, impassioned raps laid over hip hop beats, timeless acoustic guitar masterpieces, and innovative, idiosyncratic pop music. Constantly on the move, the album was recorded between LA, London, Suffolk and while crossing the Atlantic aboard the RMS Queen Mary 2. Executive produced by multi-GRAMMY winner Benny Blanco and Sheeran himself with additional production coming from frequent collaborator Johnny McDaid, GRAMMY winner Mike Elizondo, and BRIT-award winner Steve Mac. Sheeran also created the album artwork concept for \"\u00f7\" , even painting the cover himself.",
            "Unveiled in tandem last Friday, the album's first singles \"Shape Of You\" and \"Castle On The Hill\" highlight a clear divide to his musical spectrum - the former being an inventive dismantling and rebuilding of modern-pop using little more than a loop pedal juxtaposed by a stadium-ready, rocker with hdriving beats and Springsteen-esque riffs. Together the two singles logged over 13 million global streams in the first 24 hours, breaking Spotify's 'day 1' streaming record. With \"Shape Of You\" tallying 6,868,642 streams and \"Castle On The Hill\" landing 6,168,395 streams, both of the new tracks have individually had overtaken the previous 'day one' record holders (One Direction logged 4,759,698 streams with \"Drag Me Down\" in August 2015) marking another record-breaking milestone in his career. Meanwhile, the accompanying lyric videos received over 60 million combined hits, having amounted over 10 million views in the first 24 hours - these mark his fastest-ever video launches, with the accompanying official videos still to come.",
            "Ed Sheeran - an 11-time GRAMMY nominee and multi-GRAMMY winner - has quickly established himself as one of the world's biggest musical artists with over 22 million albums sold and 4.7 billionSpotify streams. Both of his studio albums are now platinum, along with multiple platinum singles under his belt. The British singer-songwriter's second full length album \u2018x' (pronounced multiply) - released in 2014 - proved to be both a critical and commercial phenomenon. After debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200 upon its release, the album has since been certified 4x-Platinum in the US and earned two GRAMMY nominations, including the prestigious Album Of The Year. Additionally, \"x\" spawned four consecutive multi-platinum singles in \"Sing,\" \"Don't,\" \"Photograph,\" and his global smash and biggest single to date \"Thinking Out Loud,\" which marked his first #1 at Top 40 radio and won a pair of GRAMMY awards, including highly coveted \"Song Of The Year.\""

            "The 1973 mega-smash (741 weeks on the charts) that proved to be the all-time rock classic Floyd had promised since the beginning! Intoxicating songs, production, sound effects and instrumental excursions made this one of the best albums of it's decade: \"Time,\" \"Money,\" \"Speak to Me/Breathe,\" \"The Great Gig in the Sky,\" \"Us and Them,\" \"On the Run\" and more. Parlophone.-The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth album by the English rock band Pink Floyd. Originally released in March 1973, on the label Harvest, it built on ideas explored in the band's earlier recordings and live shows, but departs from instrumental thematic by founding member Syd Barrett. The album explores themes including conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state. Developed during live performances, an early version was premiered several months before recording began; new material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road in London. The group used some advanced recording techniques at the time, including multitrack recording and tape loops. Analogue synthesizers were prominent in several tracks, and snippets from recorded interviews with Pink Floyd's road crew and others provided philosophical quotations throughout. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many distinctively notable sonic aspects and the recruitment of non-lexical singer Clare Torry. The album's iconic sleeve, designed by Storm Thorgerson, depicts a prism dispersing light into colour and represents the band's lighting, the record's thematic material, and keyboardist Richard Wright's \"simple and bold\" design request. The Dark Side of the Moon was an immediate success; it topped the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart for a week and remained in the chart for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988. With an estimated 45 million copies sold, it is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling worldwide. It has been remastered and re-released twice, and covered in it's entirety by several other acts. It produced two singles, \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\", and is the band's most popular album among fans and critics, and has been ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time."

            "GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY AWESOME MIX VOL. 1 is the collection of songs featured in the film. Music plays a major role in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY as the 1970s songs featured in the film are part of the storyline in a unique way. Explaining how the songs come to play in the story, director James Gunn says, 'One of the main story points in the movie is that Quill has this compilation tape (Awesome Mix #1) that he got from his mother before she died that she made for him. It was of songs that she loved, all songs from the 1970s, and that's the only thing he has left of his mother and that's the only thing he has left of his home on Earth. He uses that as a connection to his past and to the sadness that he feels of having left all that and lost all that.' From Marvel, the studio that brought you the global blockbuster franchises of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and The Avengers, comes a new team the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. An action packed, epic space adventure, Marvel's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe into the cosmos, where brash adventurer Peter Quill finds himself the object of an unrelenting bounty hunt after stealing a mysterious orb coveted by Ronan, a powerful villain with ambitions that threaten the entire universe. To evade the ever persistent Ronan, Quill is forced into an uneasy truce with a quartet of disparate misfits Rocket, a gun toting raccoon, Groot, a tree like humanoid, the deadly and enigmatic Gamora and the revenge driven Drax the Destroyer. But when Quill discovers the true power of the orb and the menace it poses to the cosmos, he must do his best to rally his ragtag rivals for a last, desperate stand with the galaxy's fate in the balance.Marvel's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, which first appeared in comic books in Marvel Super Heroes, Issue #18 (Jan. 1969), stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, featuring Vin Diesel as Groot, Bradley Cooper as Rocket, Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, with John C. Reilly, Glenn Close as Nova Prime and Benicio Del Toro as The Collector. James Gunn is the director of the film with Kevin Feige, p.g.a., producing. Louis D'Esposito, Alan Fine, Victoria Alonso, Jeremy Latcham, Nik Korda and Stan Lee serve as executive producers. Marvel's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is written by James Gunn and Nicole Perlman."

These include \"I Heard It through the Grapevine,\" \"Lodi,\" \"Up Around the B ,\" \"Who'll Stop the Rain,\" and of course \"Bad Moon Rising.\" This is an excellent greatest-hits collection, and a perfect introduction to the music of a band that has been enduringly influential.",

Also includes such well-known jazz musicians as Cannonball Adderly, Paul Chambers, James Cobb, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, & Wynton Kelly. This painterly masterpiece is one of the most important, influential and popular albums in jazz. At the time it was made, Kind of Blue was also a revolution all it's own. Turning his back on standard chord progressions, trumpeter Miles Davis used modal scales as a starting point for composition and improvisation. This recording has been mastered by the K2 HD format of 24-bit 100 kHz, which creates an unbelievable sound surpassing other formats! 24-Bit/100 kHz Mastering!

            "This is the one jazz record owned by people who don't listen to jazz, and with good reason. The band itself is extraordinary (proof of Miles Davis's masterful casting skills, if not of God's existence), listing John Coltrane and Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley on saxophones, Bill Evans (or, on \"Freddie Freeloader,\" Wynton Kelly) on piano, and the crack rhythm unit of Paul Chambers on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums. Coltrane's astringency on tenor is counterpoised to Adderley's funky self on alto, with Davis moderating between them as Bill Evans conjures up a still lake of sound on which they walk. Meanwhile, the rhythm partnership of Cobb and Chambers is prepared to click off time until eternity. It was the key recording of what became modal jazz, a music free of the fixed harmonies and forms of pop songs. In Davis's men's hands it was a weightless music, but one that refused to fade into the background. In retrospect every note seems perfect, and each piece moves inexorably towards its destiny. --John Szwed"

Coltrane's astringency on tenor is counterpoised to Adderley's funky self on alto, with Davis moderating between them as Bill Evans conjures up a still lake of sound on which they walk. Meanwhile, the rhythm partnership of Cobb and Chambers is prepared to click off time until eternity. It was the key recording of what became modal jazz, a music free of the fixed harmonies and forms of pop songs. In Davis's men's hands it was a weightless music, but one that refused to fade into the background. In retrospect every note seems perfect, and each piece moves inexorably towards its destiny.",

            "Review",
            "\"As the painter needs his framework of parchment, the improvising musical group needs its framework in time,\" says Bill Evans in the liner notes to Kind of Blue. \"Miles Davis presents here frameworks which are exquisite in their simplicity and yet contain all that is necessary to stimulate performance with a sure reference to the primary conception.\" Amen. During the past 40 years, the performances Davis' stimulated from Evans, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb, and Wynton Kelly have become some of the most storied in jazz, and all of them - classics such as \"Freddie the Freeloader,\" \"All Blues,\" \"Blue in Green,\" and, of course, \"So What\" (featured) - are featured on this Columbia/Legacy reissue.",

            "This first-take, unrehearsed Miles Davis session from 1959, no less than a jazz/blues succes d' estime, offers stimulation for the mind and satisfaction for the soul. The late trumpeter and his fellow improvisers (notably John Coltrane and Bill Evans) create shifting prismatic colors, textures given over to lyricism, and intriguingly vague tonality within five compositions. A quiet, wondrous state of equilibrium between tension and repose.",

Kind of Blue 50th Anniversary Legacy Edition offers the complete studio sessions on 2 CDs, including false starts, alternate takes and a 17-minute 1960 live version of \"So What.\" the Legacy Edition exposes a new generation to Miles Davis and places this historic event in context offering over 2 hours of audio that illustrates how this unparalleled ensemble evolved; plus never-before- heard session talk; and accompanying liner notes rich with detail, written specifically for the golden anniversary."

            "Kind of Blue is a studio album by American jazz musician Miles Davis, originally released on August 17, 1959, by Columbia Records. Recording sessions for the album took place at Columbia's 30th Street Studio in New York City on March 2 and April 22, 1959. The sessions featured Davis's ensemble sextet, with pianist Bill Evans, drummer Jimmy Cobb, bassist Paul Chambers, and saxophonists John Coltrane and Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley. After the entry of Evans into his sextet, Davis followed up on the modal experimentations of Milestones (1958) by basing Kind of Blue entirely on modality, in contrast to his earlier work with the hard bop style of jazz. Though precise figures have been disputed, Kind of Blue has been described by many music writers not only as Davis's best-selling album, but as the best-selling jazz record of all time. On October 7, 2008, it was certified quadruple platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It has been regarded by many critics as the greatest jazz album of all time and Davis's masterpiece. The album's influence on music, including jazz, rock, and classical music, has led music writers to acknowledge it as one of the most influential albums ever made. In 2002, it was one of fifty recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. In 2003, the album was ranked number 12 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time."

She lived in a New Jersey trailer park and decked her homestead in flags, streamers and seasonally inappropriate Christmas lights.

            "Between smashing it on guest vocal performances, Sam was crafting his own unique songs.'I said to myself, I don't want to have a genre. I wanted to take a risk.' In the course of putting it together, Sam has worked with so many blue chip collaborative names: Fraser T Smith, Two Inch Punch, Eg White. But he has retained his sense of self. After his sublime debut EP entitled Nirvana , his first full release will be the albums big pop moment, 'Do It For The Love', a song that sounds like an instant, out of the box smash. But there is melancholiawithin. Centering on the subject on an unrequited love, it is duty bound to make the listener a little teary as it uplifts. I think so. I've been talking about album titles and people are saying oh but it s too sad but that s what it s about. I was sad and I wrote about being sad. Hopefully I ll be happier soon and I'll write about that.  His musical purity is starting to ring the right bells. Adele has tweeted her support. After one single show in New York he has become something of a cause celebre for global soulman, Maxwell. 'He's a great friend to have. He ties to Jessie Ware, Naughty Boy and that whole scene of London underground talent that is taking their new soul to themainstream.' Sam Smith might yet be at the vanguard of a wave of British talent schooled through the verbal brilliance of Jill Scott, India Arie and Angie Stone in the States a decade ago. Why does he believe stardom beckons? 'When it came to writing and delivering I'd worked out that it was all about truth. When you listen to my album, the songs I love and my label love, it s all the personal things. That are relatable to other people.'",

Principally recorded at Westlake Audio, Los Angeles, California. The finest example of perfect disco pop, and a record that should be prescribed to musical snobs and manic depressives. The album is a true ambassador of what pop music can be. Jackson whoops and dances through a suite of unforgettable melodies that should be danced to with a smile on your face. Each track offers at least one musical hook, whether it is the beauty of 'Human Nature' (who can resist the 'dada dada da da da') or the 'whoo whoo' of 'Billie Jean'. It's all too good."

            "2-LP SET includes- Heavyweight 180 gram vinyl- Gatefold sleeve, full color inner bags- 16-page 275mmx275mm booklet with unseen photographs from 1993 sessions- Download cardThe Endless River represents a return to the creative principles that informed the writing process that produced Pink Floyd classics like Echoes, Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Animals.In early 1993, David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright set up their equipment in their own Britannia Row Studios in Islington and created more than hundred pieces of music by jamming together, interacting with each other's performances and recording the results.They then honed the pieces at David's Astoria floating studio, played them live for 2 days at Olympic Studios in Barnes with an extended lineup (Guy Pratt on bass, Jon Carin on keyboards and Gary Wallis on percussion). After that, the core trio returned to Astoria, and worked further on the compositions, alongside co-producer Bob Ezrin, refining the structure, tempos and arrangements. The result, after lyrics and vocals were added, was the 12 million selling 'Division Bell' album.At the time, there had been talk of a separate ambient album being created from the non-vocal tracks not subsequently issued on 'The Division Bell', but the idea was eventually dropped.In 2014 David Gilmour and Nick Mason re-entered the studio and, starting with unreleased keyboard performances by Richard Wright, who sadly died in 2008, added further instrumentation to the tracks, as well as creating new material. The result is The Endless River, including 60% of recordings other than the 1993 sessions, but based upon them. The title is a further link, '... the endless river\u2026' being part of the closing phrases of High Hopes, the final song of the previous Pink Floyd album. David Gilmour describes the record as follows: \"The Endless River has as its starting point the music that came from the 1993 Division Bell sessions. We listened to over 20 hours of the three of us playing together and selected the music we wanted to work on for the new album. Over the last year we've added new parts, re-recorded others and generally harnessed studio technology to make a 21st century Pink Floyd album. With Rick gone, and with him the chance of ever doing it again, it feels right that these revisited and reworked tracks should be made available as part of our repertoire.\"Stylistically, The Endless River includes all of the musical elements that characterize Pink Floyd: mellifluous keyboards, jazz-tinged drums, musique concrete, ethereal vocals, and distinctive, emotional lead guitar. As well as Pink Floyd's trademark backing vocals, there is one vocal track, with lyrics by author Polly Samson, who also contributed to The Division Bell. Double 180 gm vinyl LP pressing in a gatefold sleeve with full color inner sleeves, a 16 page deluxe booklet with rare photos from the 1993 session plus digital download. 2014 release, the 15th and final studio album from the veteran British Rock band. David Gilmour and Nick Mason went back and completed previously unreleased material recorded with the late Rick Wright. Gilmour began work on this project by returning to some 20 hours of leftover material plus material recorded with Pink Floyd touring musicians Guy Pratt on bass, Jon Carin on keyboards and Gary Wallis on percussion. A portion of these original recordings became THE DIVISION BELL, while the rest remained in the vaults. The album was co-produced with Phil Manzanera, Youth and Andy Jackson."

            "The Endless River - VINYL LP - The Endless River is the fifteenth and final studio album by the British progressive rock band Pink Floyd. It was released by Parlophone and Columbia Records in Friday-release countries on 7 November 2014, and in the United Kingdom and United States on 10 November 2014. It is Pink Floyd's only studio album since the death of keyboardist and founding member Rick Wright, who appears posthumously, and the third led by guitarist and singer David Gilmour following Roger Waters' departure in 1985. It is also the first Pink Floyd album distributed by Parlophone and Warner Bros. Records following the purchase of EMI. - The Endless River consists almost entirely of instrumental and ambient music, and is based on hours of previously unreleased material Pink Floyd wrote, recorded and produced with Wright during sessions for it's predecessor, 1994's The Division Bell. New material was recorded in 2013 through 2014 aboard Gilmour's Astoria boat studio and in Medina Studios in Hove, England. It was produced by Gilmour, Youth, Andy Jackson and Phil Manzanera. The cover concept is by Ahmed Emad Eldin, with sleeve design and final artwork by Stylorouge and creative direction by Aubrey Powell."

            "The Endless River is the fifteenth and final studio album by the British progressive rock band Pink Floyd. It was released by Parlophone and Columbia Records in Friday-release countries on 7 November 2014, and in the United Kingdom and United States on 10 November 2014. It is Pink Floyd's only studio album since the death of keyboardist and founding member Rick Wright, who appears posthumously, and the third led by guitarist and singer David Gilmour following Roger Waters' departure in 1985. It is also the first Pink Floyd album distributed by Parlophone and Warner Bros. Records following the purchase of EMI. - The Endless River consists almost entirely of instrumental and ambient music, and is based on hours of previously unreleased material Pink Floyd wrote, recorded and produced with Wright during sessions for it's predecessor, 1994's The Division Bell. New material was recorded in 2013 through 2014 aboard Gilmour's Astoria boat studio and in Medina Studios in Hove, England. It was produced by Gilmour, Youth, Andy Jackson and Phil Manzanera. The cover concept is by Ahmed Emad Eldin, with sleeve design and final artwork by Stylorouge and creative direction by Aubrey Powell."

Following the disbanding of bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard's previous group Mother Love Bone, the two recruited vocalist Eddie Vedder, guitarist Mike McCready, and drummer Dave Krusen to form Pearl Jam in 1990. Most of the songs began as instrumental jams, to which Vedder added lyrics about topics such as depression, homelessness, and abuse. Ten was not an immediate success, but by late 1992 it had reached #2 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album produced three hit singles: \"Alive\", \"Even Flow\", and \"Jeremy\"."

The group's fourth--and arguably their finest--album is as much a tribute to his technique as a monument to his versatility. Page produced the album, co-wrote all eight songs, and played mandolin as well as all the guitars. Musically, this 1971 disc ranges from acoustic English folke (\"Goin' to California\" and \"The Battle of Evermore,\" the latter featuring the late Fairport Convention frontwoman Sandy Denny) to bone-crushing, bluesy riff-slinging. On the album's centerpiece, \"Stairway to Heaven,\" these light and dark strains are dramatically intertwined. The chiming \"Four Sticks\" aside, it's the Little Richard-inspired \"Rock and Roll\" and the tricky time changes--a Zeppelin trademark--of the fast-and-furious \"Black Dog\" that elevate this album into more than just a bustle in aspiring guitarists' hedgerows.",

The albumhas also frequently been tagged by critics as one of themost influential heavy metal albums of all time.  Yet by bookending the album with two slices of thrashmayhem ( Battery and Damage, Inc. ), the band reignstriumphant through sheer force of sound, of will, of malice.The arrangements are thick and muscular, and the materialvaries enough in texture and tempo to hold interest throughall its twists and turns.

The digital versions of ABBA have been created following weeks and months of motion-capture and performance techniques with the four band members and an 850-strong team from Industrial Light & Magic. Now, an incredible 40 years since their last studio album 'The Visitors', ABBA have not only recorded two new songs, 'I Still Have Faith In You' and 'Don't Shut Me Down', that will both feature in the concert, but they have recorded and produced an entire new album. 'Voyage' was recorded together at Benny's studio Riksmixningsverket in Stockholm."

An exciting revisit of Elvis' work, If I Can Dream focuses on the iconic artist's unmistakable voice, emphasizing the pure power of The King of Rock and Roll. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London with acclaimed producers Don Reedman and Nick Patrick, the 14-track album features Elvis' most dramatic original performances augmented with lush new arrangements by The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. \"This would be a dream come true for Elvis,\" Priscilla Presley says of the project. \"He would have loved to play with such a prestigious symphony orchestra. The music... The force that you feel with his voice and the orchestra is exactly what he would have done.\" Don Reedman also commented, \"Abbey Road Studios and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra are as good as it gets and Elvis deserves as good as it gets.\" The album features a scintillating duet with best-selling jazz-pop singer Michael Bubl\u00e9 on \"Fever.\" The album also includes additional contributions by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame guitarist Duane Eddy adding his signature sound to \"An American Trilogy\" and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" and Italian operatic pop trio Il Volo lending their outstanding vocals to \"It's Now or Never.\" As arranger Nick Patrick said, \"This is the record he would have loved to make.\" If I Can Dream also highlights Elvis Presley's diverse musical tastes and appreciation for great vocalists spanning a variety of genres from standards to opera."

Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London with acclaimed producers Don Reedman and Nick Patrick, the 14-track album features Elvis' most dramatic original performances augmented with lush new arrangements by The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. \"This would be a dream come true for Elvis,\" Priscilla Presley says of the project. \"He would have loved to play with such a prestigious symphony orchestra. The music... The force that you feel with his voice and the orchestra is exactly what he would have done.\" Don Reedman also commented, \"Abbey Road Studios and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra are as good as it gets and Elvis deserves as good as it gets.\" The album features a scintillating duet with best-selling jazz-pop singer Michael Bubl\u00e9 on \"Fever.\" The album also includes additional contributions by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame guitarist Duane Eddy adding his signature sound to \"An American Trilogy\" and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" and Italian operatic pop trio Il Volo lending their outstanding vocals to \"It's Now or Never.\" As arranger Nick Patrick said, \"This is the record he would have loved to make.\" If I Can Dream also highlights Elvis Presley's diverse musical tastes and appreciation for great vocalists spanning a variety of genres from standards to opera."

Recorded at the Sweet Silence Studios with producer Flemming Rasmussen, it was the first Metallica album released on a major label. Master of Puppets is the band's last album to feature bassist Cliff Burton, who died in a bus crash during the album's promotional tour. The album peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200 and became the first thrash metal album to be certified platinum. It was certified 6\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2003 for shipping six million copies in the United States. The cover was designed by Metallica and Peter Mensch and painted by Don Brautigam. It depicts a cemetery field of white crosses tethered to strings, manipulated by a pair of hands in a blood-red sky."

            "Hybrid Theory is the debut album by the American rock band Linkin Park, released on October 24, 2000 through Warner Bros. Records. The album was a commercial success, having been certified Diamond for sales of over 10 million units in the United States alone as of 2010, peaking at number two on the Billboard 200, and also reaching high positions on other charts worldwide. Recorded at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California, and produced by Don Gilmore, the album's lyrical themes deal with problems lead vocalist Chester Bennington experienced during his adolescence, including drug abuse and the constant fighting and divorce of his parents. Hybrid Theory takes it's title from the previous name of the band as well as the concept of music theory and combining different styles. Four singles were released from the album: \"One Step Closer\", \"Crawling\", \"Paper cut\", and \"In the End\", all of them being responsible for launching Linkin Park into mainstream popularity. While \"In the End\" was the most successful of the four, all of the singles in the album remain some of the band's most successful songs to date. Although \"Runaway\", \"Points of Authority\", and \"My December\" from the special edition bonus disc album were not released as singles, they were minor hits on alternative rock radio stations thanks to the success of all of the band's singles and the album. At the 2002 Grammy Awards, Hybrid Theory was nominated for Best Rock Album. The album is listed in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. It was ranked #11 on Billboard's Hot 200 Albums of the Decade.A special edition of Hybrid Theory was released March 11, 2002, a year and a half after it's original pressing. Hybrid Theory has sold 27 million copies worldwide, which makes it the best selling debut album of the 21st century. Linkin Park performed the album in it's entirety for the first time at the Download Festival on June 14, 2014."

Thematically, it explores death and dying from myriad points of view: nuclear war (\"Fight Fire with Fire\"), electric-chair execution (the title track), and drowning (\"Trapped Under Ice\"). Interestingly, the best track on this album is probably \"Fade to Black,\" a slower, more introspective song about suicide. There's also \"Creeping Death,\" which remains a concert favorite. An excellent mix of rapid-fire guitar riffs, rip-roaring solos, and singer James Hetfield's trademark growl, this is thrash metal at its finest. Very highly recommended.",

            "Prince designed \"Purple Rain\" as the project that would make him a superstar, and surprisingly, that is exactly what happened. Simultaneously more focused and ambitious than any of his previous records, \"Purple Rain\" finds Prince consolidating his funk and R&B roots while moving boldly into pop, rock, and heavy metal with nine superbly crafted songs. Although Prince's songwriting is at a peak, the presence of the Revolution pulls the music into sharper focus, giving it a tougher, more aggressive edge. Even with all of his new, but uncompromising, forays into pop Prince hasn't abandoned funk. Taken together, all of the stylistic experiments add up to a stunning statement of purpose that remains one of the most exciting rock & roll albums ever created."

This collection of songs takes his music to a new place, drawing inspiration in part from the Southern California pop records of the late '60s and early '70s.

            "Reflecting an age of innocence and a time of wonder, no film better captures the pure magic of Disney than BAMBI -- the world's most endearing animated tale about the beauty of nature and the miracle of life. Nominated for three Academy Awards(R), this immortal blend of classic storytelling and unforgettable characters is most fondly remembered as Walt Disney's all-time favorite picture. As morning light breaks across the meadow, a new prince of the forest is born. Soon Bambi emerges from the thicket on wobbly legs, much to the delight of his new friends, Thumper, the playful rabbit, and Flower, the bashful yet lovable skunk. But the fun of skating on \"stiff water,\" nibbling fresh blossoms, and frolicking through the woods is only the beginning. Exploring his new world, and guided by the wisdom of Friend Owl, Bambi learns valuable lessons with every adventure --experiencing love, loss, growth, and renewal along the way. Fully restored to its original theatrical splendor, this digitally remastered video edition of BAMBI can now take its place among your most cherished family keepsakes. Relive Disney's extraordinary movie masterpiece \"filled with laughter and inspired animation!\" (Time Magazine)",

            "It always comes up when people are comparing their most traumatic movie experiences: \"the death of Bambi's mother,\" a recollection that can bring a shudder to even the most jaded filmgoer.

            "covers a year in the life of a young deer. But in a bigger way, it measures the life cycle itself, from birth to adulthood, from childhood's freedom to grown-up responsibility. All of this is rendered in cheeky, fleet-footed style--the movie doesn't lecture, or make you feel you're being fed something that's good for you. The animation is miraculous, a lush forest in which nature is a constantly unfolding miracle (even in a spectacular fire, or those dark moments when \"man was in the forest\"). There are probably easier animals to draw than a young deer, and the Disney animators set themselves a challenge with Bambi's wobbly glide across an ice-covered lake, his spindly legs akimbo; but the sequence is effortless and charming. If Bambi himself is just a bit dull--such is the fate of an Everydeer--his rabbit sidekick Thumper and a skunk named Flower more than make up for it. Many of the early Disney features have their share of lyrical moments and universal truths, but",

            "Mastered from the original master tapes, and possessing a richness befitting the album's stellar reputation, Mobile Fidelity's numbered limited-edition Hybrid SACD of Brothers in Arms breathes with transparent highs, atmospheric heft, and lifelike tonalities. The sense of realism this edition delivers will leave slack-jawed even the most hard-to-please audiophiles. As the recipient of the Grammy for Best-Engineered Recording, the album has always been a go-to sonic standard, but never has it sounded so reach-out-and-touch-it realistic as it does here. Although it's easy to speculate that the colossal success of Brothers in Arms relates to it's timing - it's release during an era obsessed with catchy singles, flashy MTV videos, and whistle-friendly melodies - reasons for the album's chart-busting success primarily owe to the expertly crafted songs and memorable playing turned in by a group hitting it's creative peak. Not to mention the spatial dimensions that cause instruments and vocals to naturally float in a fixed area. Anchored by \"Money for Nothing,\" a caustically themed smash immediately identifiable via Mark Knopfler's resonant finger-picked guitar riff and Sting's \"I want my MTV\" vocal refrain, Dire Straits' fifth album is stuffed with bluesy signatures, jazz-rock motifs, clever lyrics, and organic accents. Diversity and consistency also extend to the songs' moods. Singing with his trademark light-to-the-touch timbre, Knopfler conjures feelings of poignancy, peacefulness, and mellowness, channeling wistfulness on the Top 10 single \"So Far Away\" and somber assurance on \"Why Worry.\""

            "Limited double 180gm vinyl LPs pressed at 45RPMs. Mobile Fidelity's numbered limited-edition breathes with transparent highs, atmospheric heft, and lifelike tonalities. The sense of realism this edition delivers will leave slack-jawed even the most demanding listeners. Never has it sounded so reach-out-and-touch-it realistic as it does on this analog pressing. All of the hallmark characteristics - ample spaciousness, ideal balances, widescreen dynamics, immersive depth, lush production - are here in spades. This is the hand-down ultimate sounding version of this audiophile favorite ever made. 1985's Brothers in Arms has sold more than nine million copies in U.S. alone and ranks #351 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. One of the world's best-selling records and an era-defining Grammy-winning set that catapulted an acclaimed band to arena status, Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms is the kind of epic spectacular that comes around only once or twice a decade. The album remains idiosyncratic for it's covetable combination of adventurous songwriting, precision-based performances, and reference-caliber fidelity. Mastered from the original master tapes, pressed at RTI, and possessing a richness befitting the album's stellar reputation."

            "Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 12 September 1975 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and a day later by Columbia Records in the United States. Inspired by material the group composed while performing around Europe, Wish You Were Here was recorded during numerous recording sessions at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Some of the songs on the album critique the music business, others express alienation and the track \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" is a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental breakdown had forced him to leave the group seven years earlier after the release of the group's debut studio album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. It was also lead writer Roger Waters's idea to split \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" into two parts and use it to bookend the album around three new compositions, introducing a new concept as the group had done with their previous album, The Dark Side of the Moon. As with The Dark Side of the Moon, the band used studio effects and synthesizers, and brought in guest singers to supply vocals on some tracks of the album. These singers were Roy Harper, who provided the lead vocals on \"Have a Cigar\", and the Blackberries, who added backing vocals to \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\". It appears on Rolling Stone's lists of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" and the \"50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time\". \u2022The stereo remastered album on heavyweight 180g vinyl \u2022Original UK release date: September 1975 \u2022Certified six times platinum \u2022Reached 1 in the UK and the US."

            "The Beatles in mono: This is how most listeners first heard the group in the 1960s, when mono was the predominant audio format. Up until 1968, each Beatles album was given a unique mono and stereo mix, but the group always regarded the mono as primary. THE BEATLES REVOLVER is released in mono on 180-gram vinyl with faithfully replicated artwork, newly mastered from the analogue master tapes. In an audiophile-minded undertaking, The Beatles' acclaimed mono albums have been newly mastered for vinyl from quarter-inch master tapes at Abbey Road Studios by GRAMMY\u00ae-winning engineer Sean Magee and GRAMMY\u00ae-winning mastering supervisor Steve Berkowitz. While THE BEATLES IN MONO CD boxed set released in 2009 was created from digital remasters, for this new vinyl project, Magee and Berkowitz cut the records without using any digital technology. Instead, they employed the same procedures used in the 1960s, guided by the original albums and by detailed transfer notes made by the original cutting engineers. Working in the same room at Abbey Road where most of The Beatles' albums were initially cut, the pair first dedicated weeks to concentrated listening, fastidiously comparing the master tapes with first pressings of the mono records made in the 1960s. Using a rigorously tested Studer A80 machine to play back the precious tapes, the new vinyl was cut on a 1980s-era VMS80 lathe. Manufactured for the world at Optimal Media in Germany, The Beatles' albums are presented in their original glory, both sonically and in their packaging."

The Lead track from the album, \u201cDon\u2019t Start Now,\u201d is already a worldwide hit with over 381 million streams and an iTunes global #1. The song is an adrenalin-fueled, feel good dancefloor anthem of positivity and self-empowerment that announces a new era for the global pop star. Dua arrived in style in 2015 with her self-titled, chart topping debut album which eclipsed 4 million sales worldwide with single sales reaching over 40 million. Dua Lipa is also officially the most streamed album by a female artist in Spotify history. The Video for her breakout global #1 hit \u201cNew Rules\u201d made her the youngest female solo artist to reach one billion views on YouTube, and the track became the first to spend a record 45 weeks on the billboard pop songs chart. Dua made Brit Award history in 2018 by becoming the first female artist to pick up five nominations, with two wings for British Breakthrough Act and British Female Solo Artist, all while selling out tours around the world. In early 2019, she received two Grammy awards for best new artist and best dance recording. Her newest single \u201cDon\u2019t Start Now\u201d debuted at #1 on the worldwide iTunes chart and was the #1 trending video on YouTube upon its release."

            "Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 12 September 1975 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and a day later by Columbia Records in the United States. Inspired by material the group composed while performing around Europe, Wish You Were Here was recorded during numerous recording sessions at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Some of the songs on the album critique the music business, others express alienation and the track \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" is a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental breakdown had forced him to leave the group seven years earlier after the release of the group's debut studio album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. It was also lead writer Roger Waters' idea to split \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" into two parts and use it to bookend the album around three new compositions, introducing a new concept as the group had done with their previous album, The Dark Side of the Moon. As with The Dark Side of the Moon, the band used studio effects and synthesizers, and brought in guest singers to supply vocals on some tracks of the album. These singers were Roy Harper, who provided the lead vocals on \"Have a Cigar\", and the Blackberries, who added backing vocals to \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\". - Wish You Were Here was an instant commercial success (despite the fact that Harvest Records' parent company EMI was unable to print enough copies of the album to satisfy commercial demand), and although it initially received mixed reviews, the album has since gone on to receive critical acclaim. It appears on Rolling Stone's lists of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" and the \"50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time\". Band members Richard Wright and David Gilmour have cited Wish You Were Here as their favourite Pink Floyd album, and many critics and fans have considered the album to be the band's magnum opus."

The song is an adrenalin-fueled, feel good dancefloor anthem of positivity and self-empowerment that announces a new era for the global pop star. Dua arrived in style in 2015 with her self-titled, chart topping debut album which eclipsed 4 million sales worldwide with single sales reaching over 40 million. Dua Lipa is also officially the most streamed album by a female artist in Spotify history. The Video for her breakout global #1 hit \u201cNew Rules\u201d made her the youngest female solo artist to reach one billion views on YouTube, and the track became the first to spend a record 45 weeks on the billboard pop songs chart. Dua made Brit Award history in 2018 by becoming the first female artist to pick up five nominations, with two wings for British Breakthrough Act and British Female Solo Artist, all while selling out tours around the world. In early 2019, she received two Grammy awards for best new artist and best dance recording. Her newest single \u201cDon\u2019t Start Now\u201d debuted at #1 on the worldwide iTunes chart and was the #1 trending video on YouTube upon its release."

            "This deluxe SACD reissue from APO of Pink Floyd s masterpiece Wish You Were Here was mixed for both 5.1 surround sound and 2-channel stereo from the original analog master tapes by Pink Floyd s Producer/Engineer James Guthrie. On its release in 1975, Wish You Were Here topped the album charts in both the UK and the U.S. Reflecting the band s thoughts of the time on the music business and exploring themes of absence, the album contains the classic cut Shine On You Crazy Diamond, a tribute to founding band member Syd Barrett. As they did with their previous release, Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd made great use of studio effects for this, their ninth album overall. The record s winding soundscapes are perfect for the canvasof multichannel SACD. Wish You Were Here was selected by Rolling Stone for their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time."

            "The Beatles' acclaimed original studio album remasters, released on CD in 2009, make their long-awaited stereo vinyl debut",
            "Manufactured on 180-gram, audiophile quality vinyl with replicated artwork, the 14 albums return to their original glory with details including the poster in The Beatles (The White Album), the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band's cut-outs, and special inner bags for some of the titles",
            "The titles include The Beatles' 12 original UK albums, first released between 1963 and 1970, the US-originated Magical Mystery Tour, now part of the group's core catalogue, and Past Masters, Volumes One & Two, first released individually in 1988, featuring non-album A-sides and B-sides, EP tracks and rarities. With this release, The Beatles' first four albums make their North American stereo vinyl debuts",
            "There has always been demand for The Beatles' albums on vinyl. Indeed, 2011's best-selling vinyl LP in the United States was Abbey Road. Following the success of The Beatles' acclaimed, GRAMMY Award-winning 2009 CD remasters, it was decided that the sound experts at EMI's Abbey Road Studios should create new versions of The Beatles' vinyl LPs. The project demanded the same meticulous approach taken for the CD releases, and the brief was a simple one: cut the digital remasters to vinyl with an absolute minimum of compromise to the sound. However, the process involved to do that was far from simple",
            "The first stage in transferring the sound of a master recording to vinyl is the creation of a disc to be used during vinyl manufacture. There were two options to consider. A Direct Metal Master (DMM), developed in the late seventies, allows sound to be cut directly into a stainless steel disc coated with a hard copper alloy. The older, alternative method is to cut the sound into the soft lacquer coating on a nickel disc - the first of several steps leading to the production of a stamper to press the vinyl",
            "A 'blind' listening test was arranged to choose between a 'lacquer' or 'copper' cut. Using both methods, A Hard Day's Night was pressed with ten seconds of silence at the beginning and end of each side. This allowed not only the reproduction of the music to be assessed, but also the noise made by the vinyl itself. After much discussion, two factors swung the decision towards using the lacquer process. First, it was judged to create a warmer sound than a DMM. Secondly, there was a practical advantage of having 'blank' discs of a consistent quality when cutting lacquers",
            "The next step was to use the Neumann VMS80 cutting lathe at Abbey Road. Following thorough mechanical and electrical tests to ensure it was operating in peak condition, engineer Sean Magee cut the LPs in chronological release order. He used the original 24-bit remasters rather than the 16-bit versions that were required for CD production. It was also decided to use the remasters that had not undergone 'limiting' - a procedure to increase the sound level, which is deemed necessary for most current pop CDs",
            "Having made initial test cuts, Magee pinpointed any sound problems that can occur during playback of vinyl records. To rectify them, changes were made to the remasters with a Digital Audio Workstation. For example, each vinyl album was listened to for any 'sibilant episodes' - vocal distortion that can occur on consonant sounds such as S and T. These were corrected by reducing the level in the very small portion of sound causing the undesired effect. Similarly, any likelihood of 'inner-groove distortion' was addressed. As the stylus approaches the centre of the record, it is liable to track the groove less accurately. This can affect the high-middle frequencies, producing a 'mushy' sound particularly noticeable on vocals. Using what Magee has described as 'surgical EQ,' problem frequencies were identified and reduced in level to compensate for this",
            "The last phase of the vinyl mastering process began with the arrival of the first batches of test pressings made from master lacquers that had been sent to the two pressing plant factories. Stringent quality tests identified any noise or click appearing on more than one test pressing in the same place. If this happened, it was clear that the undesired sounds had been introduced either during the cutting or the pressing stage and so the test records were rejected. In the quest to achieve the highest quality possible, the Abbey Road team worked closely with the pressing factories and the manufacturers of the lacquer and cutting styli",
            "An additional and unusual challenge was to ensure the proper playback of the sounds embedded in the 'lock-groove' at the end of side two of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Requiring a combination of good timing and luck, it had always been a lengthy and costly process to make it work properly. In fact, it was so tricky, it had never been attempted for American pressings of the LP. Naturally, Sean Magee and the team perfected this and the garbled message is heard as originally intended on the remastered Sgt. Pepper LP."

            "This is a Historic Album that signals a change in not only the Beatles style but the entire style of rock and roll. Revolver is the seventh studio album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 5 August 1966 on the Parlophone label (Capital Records in the U.S.), and produced by George Martin. Many of the tracks on Revolver feature an electric guitar-rock sound that contrasts with their previous LP, the folk rock inspired Rubber Soul (1965). In Britain, the fourteen tracks from Revolver were released to radio stations throughout July 1966, \"building anticipation for what would clearly be a radical new phase in the group's recording career\". It reached number one on both the British chart and American chart and stayed at the top spot for seven weeks and six weeks, respectively. Placed at number 1 in the All-Time Top 1000 Albums and number 3 in the Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, the album is often regarded as one of the greatest achievements in music history and one of the Beatles' greatest studio achievements (downloaded from wilkipedia) US CAPITOL RECORDS SONGS Side one No. Title Length 1. \"Taxman\" 2:36 2. \"Eleanor Rigby\" 2:11 3. \"Love You To\" 3:00 4. \"Here, There and Everywhere\" 2:29 5. \"Yellow Submarine\" 2:40 6. \"She Said She Said\" 2:39 Side two No. Title Length 1. \"Good Day Sunshine\" 2:08 2. \"For No One\" 2:03 3. \"I Want to Tell You\" 2:30 4. \"Got to Get You into My Life\" 2:31 5. \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" 3:00"

            "Norah Jones's debut on Blue Note is a mellow, acoustic pop affair with soul and country overtones, immaculately produced by the great Arif Mardin. (It's pretty much an open secret that the 22-year-old vocalist and pianist is the daughter of Ravi Shankar.) Jones is not quite a jazz singer, but she is joined by some highly regarded jazz talent: guitarists Adam Levy, Adam Rogers, Tony Scherr, Bill Frisell, and Kevin Breit; drummers Brian Blade, Dan Rieser, and Kenny Wolleson; organist Sam Yahel; accordionist Rob Burger; and violinist Jenny Scheinman. Her regular guitarist and bassist, Jesse Harris and Lee Alexander, respectively, play on every track and also serve as the chief songwriters. Both have a gift for melody, simple yet elegant progressions, and evocative lyrics. (Harris made an intriguing guest appearance on Seamus Blake's Stranger Things Have Happened.) Jones, for her part, wrote the title track and the pretty but slightly restless \"Nightingale.\" She also includes convincing readings of Hank Williams's \"Cold Cold Heart,\" J.D. Loudermilk's \"Turn Me On,\" and Hoagy Carmichael's \"The Nearness of You.\" There's a touch of Rickie Lee Jones in Jones's voice, a touch of Bonnie Raitt in the arrangements; her youth and her piano skills could lead one to call her an Alicia Keys for grown-ups. While the mood of this record stagnates after a few songs, it does give a strong indication of Jones' alluring talents. - David R. Adler Track Listing 1. Don't Know Why 2. Seven Years 3.

            "Limited 180gm vinyl LP pressing. Animals is the tenth studio album by Pink Floyd, originally released in January 1977. It is a concept album that provides a scathing critique of the social-political conditions of late-70s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. Animals was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but it's production was punctuated by the early signs of discord that three years later would culminate in keyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, was conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis. The album reached #2 on the UK Albums Chart. It was also a success in the United States, reaching #3 on the US Billboard 200."

            "Fear Inoculum is the long awaited new album from TOOL, and the band's first new album in 13 years. The album will be available digitally, and in a special Limited Edition physical package that includes a CD in a tri-fold Soft Pack Video Brochure featuring a 4\" HD rechargeable screen with exclusive video footage, a USB charging cable, a 2 watt speaker and a 36 page insert book and MP3 download card. Tool members include drummer Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, bassist Justin Chancellor and vocalist Maynard James Keenan. To date, Tool has released four studio albums, one EP, and one box set. Formed in 1990 in Los Angeles, California Tool emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, Undertow in 1993. Later, Tool became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of its follow-up album \u00c6nima in 1996. The band's efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued with the release of Lateralus in 2001, and 10,000 Days in 2006 - gaining Tool critical acclaim, and commercial success around the world. Tool has won three Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries."

            "Bruno Mars was riding high when his first album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, was released in late 2010. He was also writing songs as part of the successful production team the Smeezingtons, and doing some hook singing (for huge hits by Travie McCoy and B.o.B.), Mars seemed to dominate the radio and charts. Indeed, the first single from the album, the lushly romantic \"Just the Way You Are,\" was topping the singles chart. For the album, Mars worked with a large team of songwriters and producers, but still managed to come up with a record that sounds like it was written and recorded on a warm, sleepy summer Sunday afternoon. The intimate and relaxed feel can be traced to two factors; one, Mars mostly played all the instruments himself, and two, his voice is the kind of smooth instrument that slips into your ear like honey. Most of the tracks on Doo-Wops capture this laid-back groove, especially \"The Lazy Song\" and the reggaefied midnight love jam \"Our First Time.\" Mars barely raises a sweat on these tracks, cruising in low gear but with a very likeable style. It's not very deep and it's not poetry, but sweetly played and sung songs like \"Count on Me\" or \"Just the Way You Are\" project a cuddly image and will melt hearts from tweens to old folks. The only glimpse of Mars as something more than an innocuous charmer is on the song that ends the album. \"The Other Side\" features Cee Lo Green and B.o.B. and has the most complicated melody, and the best production and singing; it sounds like the only song that Mars truly invested with some soul and grit. It was also recorded way before the rest of the album, and featured on the EP that came out earlier in 2010. It points to a direction Mars could have taken with the album but didn't. ~ Tim Sendra"

            "Rank 'em how you like, Rubber Soul is an undeniable pivot point in the Fab Four's varied discography no matter where, or how, you first heard it. The album was softened up in its original 12-song American edition to jibe with the Dylan/Byrds folk-rock sound, as well as squeeze money from the Parlophone catalog. The 14-song U.K. edition--the version now available on compact disc--is a different, more dynamic, and ultimately more accomplished achievement. So many classics: \"Drive My Car\" and \"Nowhere Man\" (both omitted from the U.S. edition) merge the early combustible Beatifics to a burgeoning studio consciousness; \"The Word\" can be read as a pre-psych warning shot; the sitar-laden \"Norwegian Wood\" and the evocative \"Girl\" (the latter written on the last night of the sessions) stand as turning points in John Lennon's oeuvre. George finally emerges too, with the McGuinn-ish \"If I Needed Someone.\" EMI. 2005."

            "Vinyl LP pressing of this live release from the Grunge heroes. Recorded in November 1993, less than six months before singer Kurt Cobain killed himself, Nirvana's MTV Unplugged is a watershed document that presents a band at the peak of it's powers. Unlike any other unplugged affair, the diverse album is not a simple stripped-down regurgitation of greatest hits or a cash-it-in set of nostalgic favorites. Rather, the live effort is among the most emotionally naked spectacles ever released an album so starkly intense and profoundly personal, it's impossible not to get chills down the spine. The set list is as surprising as the stylistic makeover. Save for renditions of 'All Apologies' and 'Come As You Are', the adventurous material includes brooding covers of the Meat Puppets' 'Lake of Fire', 'Plateau', and 'Oh Me' as well as harrowing versions of David Bowie's 'The Man Who Sold the World', and the Vaselines' 'Jesus Don't Want Me for a Sunbeam'."

The group signed with Simon Cowell\\'s record label Syco Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010. Propelled to international success by social media, One Direction\\'s four albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014) topped charts in most major markets, and generated hit singles including \"What Makes You Beautiful\", \"Live While We\\'re Young\", and \"Story of My Life\". Their fifth studio album, Made in the A.M., was released in November 2015.', 'Their achievements include six Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, eleven MTV Europe Music Awards, seven American Music Awards (including Artist of the Year in 2014 and 2015), and nineteen Teen Choice Awards out of nineteen nominations, among many others. According to Nick Gatfield, the chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment UK, One Direction represented a $50 million business empire by June 2012. They were proclaimed 2012\\'s \"Top New Artist\" by Billboard. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, by April 2013, they had an estimated personal combined wealth of \u00a325 million ($41.2m) making them the second-wealthiest musicians in the UK under 30 years of age. In 2014, Forbes listed them the second-highest earning celebrities under 30, with the group earning an estimated $75 million from June 2013 to June 2014. In June 2015, Forbes listed their earnings at $130 million for the previous twelve months, and ranked them the fourth highest earning celebrities in the world.', \"After the release of Four, One Direction became the first band in the U.S. Billboard 200 history to have their first four albums debut at number one. Their third album, Midnight Memories, was the biggest-selling album worldwide of 2013 despite being released in late November. The band's Where We Are Tour in support of Midnight Memories and Four, was the highest-grossing concert tour in 2014, and the highest-grossing tour ever by a vocal group, generating $282 million. In 2014, Billboard named One Direction Artist of the Year. The band is temporarily on a hiatus that began in January 2016, which is expected to last around 18 months.\", 'Bio from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

            "Rank 'em how you like, Rubber Soul is an undeniable pivot point in the Fab Four's varied discography no matter where, or how, you first heard it. The album was softened up in its original 12-song American edition to jibe with the Dylan/Byrds folk-rock sound, as well as squeeze money from the Parlophone catalog. The 14-song U.K. edition--the version now available on compact disc--is a different, more dynamic, and ultimately more accomplished achievement. So many classics: \"Drive My Car\" and \"Nowhere Man\" (both omitted from the U.S. edition) merge the early combustible Beatifics to a burgeoning studio consciousness; \"The Word\" can be read as a pre-psych warning shot; the sitar-laden \"Norwegian Wood\" and the evocative \"Girl\" (the latter written on the last night of the sessions) stand as turning points in John Lennon's oeuvre. George finally emerges too, with the McGuinn-ish \"If I Needed Someone.\" EMI. 2005."

            "The Beatles in mono: This is how most listeners first heard the group in the 1960s, when mono was the predominant audio format. Up until 1968, each Beatles album was given a unique mono and stereo mix, but the group always regarded the mono as primary. THE BEATLES RUBBER SOUL is released in mono on 180-gram vinyl with faithfully replicated artwork, newly mastered from the analogue master tapes. In an audiophile-minded undertaking, The Beatles' acclaimed mono albums have been newly mastered for vinyl from quarter-inch master tapes at Abbey Road Studios by GRAMMY\u00ae-winning engineer Sean Magee and GRAMMY\u00ae-winning mastering supervisor Steve Berkowitz. While THE BEATLES IN MONO CD boxed set released in 2009 was created from digital remasters, for this new vinyl project, Magee and Berkowitz cut the records without using any digital technology. Instead, they employed the same procedures used in the 1960s, guided by the original albums and by detailed transfer notes made by the original cutting engineers. Working in the same room at Abbey Road where most of The Beatles' albums were initially cut, the pair first dedicated weeks to concentrated listening, fastidiously comparing the master tapes with first pressings of the mono records made in the 1960s. Using a rigorously tested Studer A80 machine to play back the precious tapes, the new vinyl was cut on a 1980s-era VMS80 lathe. Manufactured for the world at Optimal Media in Germany, The Beatles' albums are presented in their original glory, both sonically and in their packaging."

            "The Beatles' acclaimed original studio album remasters, released on CD in 2009, make their long-awaited stereo vinyl debut",
            "Manufactured on 180-gram, audiophile quality vinyl with replicated artwork, the 14 albums return to their original glory with details including the poster in The Beatles (The White Album), the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band's cut-outs, and special inner bags for some of the titles",
            "The titles include The Beatles' 12 original UK albums, first released between 1963 and 1970, the US-originated Magical Mystery Tour, now part of the group's core catalogue, and Past Masters, Volumes One & Two, first released individually in 1988, featuring non-album A-sides and B-sides, EP tracks and rarities. With this release, The Beatles' first four albums make their North American stereo vinyl debuts",
            "Rubber Soul features George Martin's 1986 stereo remix",
            "There has always been demand for The Beatles' albums on vinyl. Indeed, 2011's best-selling vinyl LP in the United States was Abbey Road. Following the success of The Beatles' acclaimed, GRAMMY Award-winning 2009 CD remasters, it was decided that the sound experts at EMI's Abbey Road Studios should create new versions of The Beatles' vinyl LPs. The project demanded the same meticulous approach taken for the CD releases, and the brief was a simple one: cut the digital remasters to vinyl with an absolute minimum of compromise to the sound. However, the process involved to do that was far from simple",
            "The first stage in transferring the sound of a master recording to vinyl is the creation of a disc to be used during vinyl manufacture. There were two options to consider. A Direct Metal Master (DMM), developed in the late seventies, allows sound to be cut directly into a stainless steel disc coated with a hard copper alloy. The older, alternative method is to cut the sound into the soft lacquer coating on a nickel disc - the first of several steps leading to the production of a stamper to press the vinyl",
            "A 'blind' listening test was arranged to choose between a 'lacquer' or 'copper' cut. Using both methods, A Hard Day's Night was pressed with ten seconds of silence at the beginning and end of each side. This allowed not only the reproduction of the music to be assessed, but also the noise made by the vinyl itself. After much discussion, two factors swung the decision towards using the lacquer process. First, it was judged to create a warmer sound than a DMM. Secondly, there was a practical advantage of having 'blank' discs of a consistent quality when cutting lacquers",
            "The next step was to use the Neumann VMS80 cutting lathe at Abbey Road. Following thorough mechanical and electrical tests to ensure it was operating in peak condition, engineer Sean Magee cut the LPs in chronological release order. He used the original 24-bit remasters rather than the 16-bit versions that were required for CD production. It was also decided to use the remasters that had not undergone 'limiting' - a procedure to increase the sound level, which is deemed necessary for most current pop CDs",
            "Having made initial test cuts, Magee pinpointed any sound problems that can occur during playback of vinyl records. To rectify them, changes were made to the remasters with a Digital Audio Workstation. For example, each vinyl album was listened to for any 'sibilant episodes' - vocal distortion that can occur on consonant sounds such as S and T. These were corrected by reducing the level in the very small portion of sound causing the undesired effect. Similarly, any likelihood of 'inner-groove distortion' was addressed. As the stylus approaches the centre of the record, it is liable to track the groove less accurately. This can affect the high-middle frequencies, producing a 'mushy' sound particularly noticeable on vocals. Using what Magee has described as 'surgical EQ,' problem frequencies were identified and reduced in level to compensate for this",
            "The last phase of the vinyl mastering process began with the arrival of the first batches of test pressings made from master lacquers that had been sent to the two pressing plant factories. Stringent quality tests identified any noise or click appearing on more than one test pressing in the same place. If this happened, it was clear that the undesired sounds had been introduced either during the cutting or the pressing stage and so the test records were rejected. In the quest to achieve the highest quality possible, the Abbey Road team worked closely with the pressing factories and the manufacturers of the lacquer and cutting styli",

Requiring a combination of good timing and luck, it had always been a lengthy and costly process to make it work properly. In fact, it was so tricky, it had never been attempted for American pressings of the LP. Naturally, Sean Magee and the team perfected this and the garbled message is heard as originally intended on the remastered Sgt. Pepper LP."

The album was softened up in its original 12-song American edition to jibe with the Dylan/Byrds folk-rock sound, as well as squeeze money from the Parlophone catalog. The 14-song U.K. edition--the version now available on compact disc--is a different, more dynamic, and ultimately more accomplished achievement. So many classics: \"Drive My Car\" and \"Nowhere Man\" (both omitted from the U.S. edition) merge the early combustible Beatifics to a burgeoning studio consciousness; \"The Word\" can be read as a pre-psych warning shot; the sitar-laden \"Norwegian Wood\" and the evocative \"Girl\" (the latter written on the last night of the sessions) stand as turning points in John Lennon's oeuvre. George finally emerges too, with the McGuinn-ish \"If I Needed Someone.\"",

            "The seeds of the collaboration were planted in 2017 when Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars toured together on the European leg of his 24K Magic World Tour. One late-night jam session on the road unlocked immediate chemistry. Just before the world slipped into quarantine, Bruno called Anderson: \u201cRemember that idea we had back in 2017? Let\u2019s do it.\u201d One studio session grew into to a months-long collaboration, culminating the \u201csetlist of doom.\u201d Legendary Bootsy Collins christened Silk Sonic and came in as the \u201cspecial guest host\u201d for An Evening With Silk Sonic, their debut album.Silk Sonic was finally set free on March 5th, 2021. Within less than a month, their debut single \u201cLeave The Door Open\u201d cracked over 230 million streams, and currently sits at 1.2 billion streams with over 346 million official video views. It reeled in rave reviews, including Variety who noted it \u201ccould be a Best R&B Song GRAMMY\u00ae winner from 1974.\u201d After petitioning the GRAMMY\u00ae Awards to #LetSilkSonicThrive, they made their debut performance with \u201cLeave The Door Open\u201d and served up a powerful tribute to Little Richard."

Through the advances in digital technology, the classic was successfully remastered with a greater clarity and intensity in 2003. The vinyl LP remains a masterpiece of hard rock."

The creation of the Ziggy Stardust persona would live on well after Bowie shed the alien skin, marking the first rock concept album by a sexually ambiguous, artistically bent musician who confounded critics at every turn. A blend of dramatic strings, swaggering saxophones, jagged guitars, and theatrical arrangements, the album's darker rock numbers like \"It Ain't Easy,\" \"Moonage Daydream,\" \"Ziggy Stardust,\" and the irresistible \"Suffragette City,\" still serve as solid excursions into the future (then and now) of rock. The buoyant \"Hang on to Yourself\" and the dreamy \"Star\" offer hints of optimism in Ziggy's bleak world. The dramatic \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\" and the image-heavy \"Star Man\" (\"he'd like to come and meet us but thinks he'd blow our minds!\") no doubt provided plenty of stage-worthy moments when Ziggy toured in the '70s, but years later they still thrill.

When they announced their 2011 world tour, fans and press went berserk. This Best Of album was released in 1994, and should be seen as a moment in time, a benchmark if you will, a standard by which they hold themselves. After this compilation was released, they would continue to perfect their sound. Best Of is the perfect pit stop on the way to Sade's later work, and now after some time it's back on vinyl!"

Songwriting credit goes to Jim Steinman on You Took the Words Right out of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night); Heaven Can Wait; All Revved Up with No Place to Go; Two out of Three Ain't Bad; Paradise by the Dashboard Light; For Crying out Loud; Great Boleros of Fire , and the title track.",

It is also his first collaboration with composer Jim Steinman and producer Todd Rundgren. He started work with producer Jim Steinman on the 'Bat Out Of Hell' horror concept album in 1972, but it was rejected by various record companies before getting a release in 1977. It went on to become a phenomenal success - with sales of over 40 million, and is now one of the most iconic and best-selling albums of all time, combining spectacular hard rock with a theatrical, almost operatic approach."

The album features guest appearances from Joyner Lucas, Royce da 5'9\", Jessie Reyez, and uncredited vocals by Justin Vernon. Eminem, credited as Slim Shady, and Dr. Dre served as executive producers, while production for individual tracks comes from a variety of musicians. American singer Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, whose vocals were uncredited on the song \"Fall\", disavowed his participation in the album, claiming that he was not in the studio when the recording was made. The full album cover, front to back, features fighter pilot, LT. Mathers III, intentionally crashing a military aircraft into an unknown object. The artwork appropriates the cover design of the 1986 Beastie Boys album, Licensed to Ill; Eminem has cited them as an inspiration for several years."

            "Led Zeppelin had a fully formed, distinctive sound from the outset, as their eponymous debut illustrates. Taking the heavy, distorted electric blues of Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, and Cream to an extreme, Zeppelin created a majestic, powerful brand of guitar rock constructed around simple, memorable riffs and lumbering rhythms. But the key to the group's attack was subtlety: it wasn't just an onslaught of guitar noise, it was shaded and textured, filled with alternating dynamics and tempos. As Led Zeppelin proves, the group was capable of such multi-layered music from the start. Although the extended psychedelic blues of \"Dazed and Confused,\" \"You Shook Me,\" and \"I Can't Quit You Baby\" often gather the most attention, the remainder of the album is a better indication of what would come later. \"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\" shifts from folky verses to pummeling choruses; \"Good Times Bad Times\" and \"How Many More Times\" have groovy, bluesy shuffles; \"Your Time Is Gonna Come\" is an anthemic hard rocker; \"Black Mountain Side\" is pure English folk; and \"Communication Breakdown\" is a frenzied rocker with a nearly punkish attack. Although the album isn't as varied as some of their later efforts, it nevertheless marked a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal."

            "TITLE : Thriller ARTIST : Michael Jackson FORMAT : Long Play Record (gatefold cover) LABEL : Epic/CBS Mastersound (Half-Speed Mastered Extended Range Recording/ Audiophile Pressing) RECORD # : HE 48112 DATE : 1982 NOTES: Off the Wall was a massive success, spawning four Top Ten hits (two of them number ones), but nothing could have prepared Michael Jackson for Thriller. Nobody could have prepared anybody for the success of Thriller, since the magnitude of its success was simply unimaginable - an album that sold 40 million copies in its initial chart run, with seven of its nine tracks reaching the Top Ten (for the record, the terrific \"Baby Be Mine\" and the pretty good ballad \"The Lady in My Life\" are not like the others). This was a record that had something for everybody, building on the basic blueprint of Off the Wall by adding harder funk, hard rock, softer ballads, and smoother soul - expanding the approach to have something for every audience. That alone would have given the album a good shot at a huge audience, but it also arrived precisely when MTV was reaching its ascendancy, and Jackson helped the network by being not just its first superstar, but first black star as much as the network helped him. This all would have made it a success (and its success, in turn, served as a new standard for success), but it stayed on the charts, turning out singles, for nearly two years because it was really, really good. True, it wasn't as tight as Off the Wall - and the ridiculous, late-night house-of-horrors title track is the prime culprit, arriving in the middle of the record and sucking out its momentum - but those one or two cuts don't detract from a phenomenal set of music. ....

            "The Best-Selling Album of All Time Celebrates It's 40th Anniversary: Michael Jackson's Thriller Receives Definitive Treatment on Mobile Fidelity's UltraDisc One-Step 180g 33RPM LP SetMastered from the Original Analog Master Tapes and Housed in a Deluxe Slipcase: Experience the Transformative Songs, Soulful Vocals, Sleek Rhythms, and Vibrant Production as If Hearing It All for the First TimePutting into perspective the incalculable impact and pioneering significance of the best-selling album of all time has never been easy. Though Michael Jackson's Thriller lays claim to mind-boggling statistics - for starters, it netted a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards and sold upwards of 70 million copies globally - that serve as reminders of how pervasive and indispensable it remains to music snobs and casual listeners alike, it's essence always traces back to the greatness, power, and scope of the songs. Now, as it celebrates it's 40th anniversary, the blockbuster that reconceptualized music via a genre- and color-blind blend of fleet pop, funk, disco, soul, and rock sent up with cinematic panache and dynamic energy; united audiences; made strides towards achieving racial equality; and taught the world how to dance sounds even more invigorating than it did during the advent of the Walkman.Mastered from the original analog master tapes, pressed at RTI, housed in a slipcase, and strictly limited to 40,000 numbered copies, Mobile Fidelity's UltraDisc One-Step 180g 33RPM LP set does for Thriller what Jackson's unforgettable appearance on the 'Motown 25' TV special in 1983 did for his career: It makes the music personal, human, desirable, relatable, imaginative - the definition of cool. This extraordinary reissue does so by presenting the songs in lifelike fashion, zeroing in on the fundamentals with laser focus, and magnifying the brilliance of the production, arrangements, and vocals in ways that let everyone experience Thriller as if hearing the album for the first time.

            "Named the sixth best album in music history by Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye's staggeringly influential What's Going On is pure soul genius and an ageless document about urban ills, employment issues, environmental concerns, and social responsibilities that's as relevant today as it was upon release in 1971. At once, the singer both revolutionized Motown's sound and upped the ante for his fellow artists. And now, the song cycle that toes the line between optimism, dismay, healing, futility, and urgency features sonics and packaging that match the groundbreaking arrangements, singing, and lyrical content within. Gaye's definitive statement reaches three-dimensional aural and emotional heights never before attained on Mobile Fidelity's opulent UD1S (UltraDisc One-Step) box set. Strictly limited to 7,500 numbered copies and pressed at RTI on SuperVinyl, this ultra-hifi keepsake brings you closer to music that redefined pop. You'll enjoy deep-black backgrounds, boundless soundstaging, pointillist details, staggering dynamics, and arguably, the most lifelike tonalities and nuances ever committed to vinyl. Experienced via UD1S, What's Going On places Gaye and his savvy instrumentalists in your room with nothing standing in the way between you and the music. This is an unsurpassed edition of a singular record no listener should be without."

            ", issued in 1971, inspired Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, and just about every other black artist on the planet to take greater responsibility for their music and its meaning. Gaye co-wrote the songs and produced the album, flavoring it with layer upon layer of his own multi-tracked vocals, oceans of hand percussion, strings, flutes, and jazzy horn solos. Spacey and loose as a spliff-fueled Sunday afternoon jam in the park, the nine songs all played like a hit single.

            "The Biggest Album Ever just got bigger. The 25th Anniversary Edition of Thriller celebrates this ground-breaking album with 7 bonus tracks, six of which are previously unreleased. The new tracks include exclusive remixes from Kanye West, Fergie, will. I. am and Akon along with a previously unreleased track from the Thriller sessions, \"For All Time, \" newly mixed and mastered by Michael Jackson. Also included is a BONUS DVD with new, digitally restored versions of the three videos from the album as well as the Michael Jackson's groundbreaking performance of \"Billie Jean\" on the \"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever\" television special (first broadcast on NBC May 16, 1983). Also included is a new personal greeting from Michael Jackson to his fans penned exclusively for this special release.",

The bonus DVD bundled with the expanded CD includes a digitally redone version of the famous title-track video, among other clips, and it still astonishes with its choreography and attitude. As for the new tracks--Fergie inserts herself into \"Beat It,\" Will.i.am takes on \"The Girl Is Mine\" and \"P.Y.T.,\" Kanye West remixes \"Billie Jean\" (with characteristically subtle brilliance), Akon duets with M-Jack on \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin',\" and the unreleased ballad \"For All Time\" (from the original Thriller sessions) is shined up and tacked on--they will suck you in like it was pop music's hugest year, 1983, all over again. Start brushing up on your moonwalk now.",

            "It's not often that you stumble across a songwriter whose lyrics both sound and read like poetry. When those lyrics are set to music that balances burning indignation with lilting tenderness, and delivered in a voice imbued with the spiritual passion and yearning of gospel and the blues, you figure you've chanced upon something special. And so it is with 23-year-old Andrew Hozier-Byrne, an Irish singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from County Wicklow who goes by the name of Hozier.Hozier releases his self-titled debut album on Columbia Records, following his two EPs Take Me To Church and From Eden. The new album produced by Ron Kirwan (PJ Harvey and Depeche Mode). Hozier will feature the hit single \"Take Me To Church\" as well as his most recent release \"Sedated.\" Raised in a musical family, Hozier's childhood and adolescent listening was dominated, he says, \"by Chicago blues, Texan blues, Chess Records, Motown, and then I discovered jazz, but more importantly, Delta blues that extraordinarily haunting sound. Skip James, Blind Willie Johnson, people like that. Later, it was Pink Floyd, Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, plus Tom Waits was a huge, huge influence. I was always drawn to singers with something haunting about their voices. The same goes for writers such as James Joyce and Oscar Wilde. You can't define what it is, but it buries itself deep in your soul.\"After a string of sold out dates and electrifying performances including TV appearances on The Late Show With David Letterman and The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Hozier will return stateside when he launches his first national headline tour this fall. The tour crisscrosses the country before wrapping up with two shows in New York City. Tastemakers and critics have wholeheartedly embraced his spirited and soulful sound. He s drawn praise from NPR, New York Magazine, KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic, MTV Buzzworthy, Consequence of Sound, and more. Most recently he was featured on NPR's All Things Considered and Tiny Desk Concert. Note : This product is a mid-20th Century mechanical technology. If the records are not cleaned prior to playback there will be quality issues."

FLOWER BOY is a 14-song album, and the physical version of the CD features two unique covers, the first one designed by Tyler himself and the other by artist Eric White. It is only fitting that Tyler would commission White, whose paintings have been described by Leah Ollman of The Los Angeles Times as being \"nostalgic and at the same time also vaguely futuristic, even dystopian,\" to visually articulate the world of FLOWER BOY."

            "Limited Deluxe Edition features all new artwork plus five previously unheard demos, remixes and B sides. 2012 sophomore album from the singer, songwriter and international superstar. The album includes production from Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, Emile Haynie, Diplo and Supa Dups, as well as the Smeezingtons, Mars' three-man songwriting and production team. He notes that the album is more musically varied and refuses to \"pick a lane\". \"Locked Out of Heaven\" was released as the lead single from the album. It has been described as having strong influences of New Wave, with striking resemblances to \"Message in a Bottle\" and \"Roxanne\" by the Police, the Romantics' \"Talking in Your Sleep\", and even Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\", while some have mildly referenced it to the Outfield's \"Your Love\"."

            "Vinyl LP pressing. This debut emerged as one of the most influential rap albums of the '90s. It laid the groundwork for the rebirth of New York hip-hop, an underground, hardcore new sound that went on to influence Biggie, Jay-Z, Nas, and Mobb Deep, among others. Rap became at once theatrical and cerebral, MCs lyricists and powerhouses capable of violence, metaphor, humor and revolution in their performing. The album is full of hard, gritty beats, references to pop culture and martial arts, eclectic piano and string sounds, as well as surrealist overtones, and there truly was nothing like it in the hip-hop world at the time. Even now, it's an original album in a league of it's own. Get it. You won't regret it."

            "Digitally re-mastered edition of the classic 1970 sophomore album from the British Hard Rock legends. If their debut album threw down the iron-studded gauntlet for all would-be early '70s Hard Rock acts daring to follow-suit, then album #2 would raise the bar yet higher still by becoming one, if not the, greatest Heavy Metal album of all-time. Released on the same day that Jimi Hendrix passed away, Paranoid would become an unstoppable tour-de-force of Rock classics lead from the front by the Top 5 pre-release single that is the iconic title track. Bolstered by further Sabbath classics in the making ('War Pigs', 'Iron Man' and 'Fairies Wear Boots'), Paranoid cemented the Birmingham four-piece as a genuine U.K. musical phenomenon and is seen by many as THE Black Sabbath album. Eight tracks. Sanctuary."
