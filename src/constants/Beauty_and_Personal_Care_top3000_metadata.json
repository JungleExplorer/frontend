The brush is designed with Nylon Pin and Tufted Bristles for detangling, improve volume and control. Styling flexibility is guaranteed with 3 Heat/Speed Settings and a Cool Option. Built to provide just the right amount of heat. Unlike conventional hair dryers, this volumizer can be placed closer to the scalp for lift. Boosted by Ionic Technology hair dries fast and helps reduce heat damage. The One Step Unit is designed for 120V USA outlets only, we do not recommend use of a voltage adapter or converter, as it will damage the unit. Note wattage will vary depending on the location of use."

            "Looking for a skin cleanser that helps you get soft skin that looks healthy and well-cared for? The No.1 dermatologist recommended body wash, Dove Deep Moisture Body Wash gives you instantly soft skin and lasting nourishment after just one shower. Dove body wash is sulfate free with a mild, pH-balanced formula, making it a great body wash for dry skin, unlike typical bath soap or shower gel. This moisturizing body wash uses Dove Moisture Renew Blend, a combination of skin-natural nourishers and plant-based moisturizers. The lipids and glycerin in our formula absorb deeply into the top layers of skin, where they get right to work! This blend of moisturizing ingredients is proven to work with your skin to nourish it, so it can maintain and create new moisture. For best results, squeeze the moisturizing body wash into your hand or onto a shower pouf and work it into a rich lather. Massage it over your skin, concentrating on areas that feel a little drier than usual. Rinse off, revealing soft, smooth skin. Made with 100 percent gentle cleansers, Dove Body Wash is gentle to skin\u2019s microbiome, its living protective layer. It creates a rich lather that moisturizes and replenishes skin while also leaving it cleansed and feeling cared for. Dove body wash is also effective at cleansing hands. With naturally derived cleansers and skin-natural nutrients,we care about what goes into our body wash. Dove sulfate-free body wash is No.1 dermatologist recommended and microbiome gentle. Dove care goes further than moisturizing body wash with PETA Cruelty-Free certification and 100 percent recycled plastic bottles. Our vision is of a world where beauty is a source of confidence, and not anxiety. So, we are on a mission to help the next generation of women develop a positive relationship with the way they look\u2014reaching over \u00bc of a billion young people with self-esteem education by 2030. We are committed to a landmark new initiative as part of our 2025 commitment to reduce plastic waste."

            "Get the precision of a Gillette shave with comfort and style. The Gillette Fusion5 Power razor blades feature 5 antifriction blades that are positioned closely together for incredible comfort and a shave you barely feel. These razor blades also feature an indicator lubrastrip which fades when you are no longer getting an optimal shave. Soft microfins help to smooth and stretch skin before the blades preparing hairs to be cut. Use the precision trimmer on the back for hard-to-reach places and styling facial hair. Not sure if these blades will fit your existing razor handle? All Gillette 5-blade razor handles will fit these Fusion5 Power razor blades (excluding GilletteLabs).",

This prolonged blending process helps to extract the entire medicinal quality of the leaves and thus makes it an effective ingredient of Indulekha Bringha Oil.Active ingredients along with the base oil create an excellent combination that is extremely beneficial for hair. Aloe vera contains enzymes which repairs dead skin cells on the scalp. It promotes hair growth, prevents itching on the scalp, reduces dandruff and conditions your hair. it rejuvenates the hair with its own nutrients, giving it more elasticity and preventing breakage.

With the Philips nose trimmer, you can be sure that all unwanted hairs will be removed efficiently. Both cutter and guard have ultra-precise and sharp cutting slots to ensure all hairs are quickly and effectively cut. The trimmer and the combs are easy to clean under the tap and can be used in the shower. The soft-touch rubber grip gives you the best hold, even when wet, for better control when you operate your trimmer. Use the 3- or 5-mm eyebrow comb to trim or tidy up hair to a uniform length. Soft pouch includes: AA battery, 2 eyebrow combs and protective cap to keep the blade clean."

            "With this compact nose, ear and detail trimmer, keeping a well-groomed appearance has never been easier. Its ultra-sharp, dual-edge blades comfortably clip nose and ear hair, detail mustaches and eyebrows, and remove unwanted facial and body hair. Fully immersible, it trims and grooms dry over the sink or wet in the shower. A powerful Vortex Cleaning system makes cleaning the blades as fast as it is simple. Uniquely curved rotating, hypo-allergenic dual-edge stainless-steel blades trim cleanly from both top and sides. And the nose clipper's precision blade alignment leaves the optimal number of nasal hairs needed to maintain the nose's healthy, natural filtering system. With Vortex cleaning, simply immerse the trimmer under running water and touch the on switch. As the blades rotate, a rapid stream of water is drawn in and flushed through the trimmer to remove stubble and residue, and ensure pristine blades for the next trim. For stubborn stubble or residue, a cleaning brush is included for quick, on-the-spot maintenance. Wipe dry with a soft towel or cloth. When you\u2019re in a hurry, the ER-GN30 provides a quick dry trim or touch-up over the sink. And because this high-quality personal trimmer is fully immersible in water, it performs just as comfortably and efficiently in the shower. At home and away, the cordless, compact trimmer provides up to 90 minutes of power with a single AA-size Alkaline battery (not included).Specifications Blades: Dual-Edge Stainless-Steel Waterproof: Fully Immersible Power Source: One AA Battery (not included) Operating Time: Up to 90 minutes Dimensions: 5.2 x 1.3 x 1.4 in Weight: 2.2 ozIncludes Panasonic ER-GN30-K Trimmer (2) Panasonic Protective Cap Panasonic Cleaning Brush Panasonic 2 Year Warranty ."

Since then, we have continued Dr. Crandall\u2019s concept of \u201chealthy beauty.\u201d To this day, every one of our products is carefully crafted and tested to meet our strict requirements: they are hypoallergenic, safe for sensitive skin and eyes, and created without any of the 150+ known harsh ingredients found in other personal care items.Package Includes: Bronzer (1)Size: 0.38 oz.This Product Is: Hypoallergenic. Paraben-Free. Gluten-Free. Cruelty-Free. Oil-Free. Non-Comedogenic."

            "Want the London look? Begin your day flawlessly. If you want to mattify oily skin, minimise the appearance of pores, or even out skin tone, Rimmel London\u2019s Stay Matte Primer does it all while also creating a velvety base for makeup that helps it stay put all day. This skin perfecting primer can be worn alone, under, or on top of makeup. The ultra lightweight formula never feels heavy or greasy and controls shine for up to 8 hours, creating a soft, perfectly matte complexion. Best of all, it doesn\u2019t clog pores or irritate skin. If you have dry skin with oily patches, try Stay Matte Primer to smooth and moisturise your skin before putting on your other makeup. Apply a small amount before applying foundation. It can be especially useful on your under-eye area to minimize pores. Pat it on, then blend in the primer over your entire face and neck, basically anywhere that will get foundation or concealer. To help your foundation or BB cream last a lot longer with less shine, Rimmel London\u2019s Stay Matte Primer is a smart addition to your makeup kit. A lovely gift for a girlfriend, sister or even your mum. Rimmel London is an inner confidence that how we look is always cool, irreverent, never predictable and always evolving. Rimmel is not perfection or intimidating, it is like London: young, urban, eclectic, edgy. It is expression with no rules, it is real, it is accessible. Live the London look."

            "Honest Amish Beard Balm is created from the finest organic ingredients available. We start with a proprietary blend of hair strengthening botanical infused in a base of Virgin Argan, Avocado, Almond, Virgin Pumpkin Seed, and Apricot Kernel Oils. It is then masterfully crafted with fruit and nut butters (Shea, Aloe, Cocoa, Kokum, to name a few), and hair enhancing essential oils. Subtle scents of Cedarwood, Anise (licorice), and Clove. We recommend that people with nut allergies avoid this product or test a small amount before application. Honest Amish Beard Balm will help soften, condition, dry splitting hairs, and nourish new growth. Our balm is also very conditioning for your skin and will stop the itching caused by new growth and wild rogue hairs. Due to the use of only natural ingredients in our beard balm, separation of the product may occur when exposed to fluctuations in temperature. The beard balm will continue to work as normal; it will just require a few extra seconds of manipulation when melting in your hands. However, to return it back to a smooth consistency it can be melted back down by placing the beard balm in a warm place (direct sun light, in car, heater vent, etc. Do not use open flames, microwaves, or stove tops) Once melted, secure the lid on your beard balm and shake it up, mixing up all the oils. Then allow to cool to room temperature or place in refrigerator for faster solidification. Beard Balm may liquefy in transit USE CAUTION WHEN OPENING. We use absolutely NO man made chemicals or preservatives and NO fake fragrances or colorants in any of our products. Packaged in a 100 percent recyclable tin. Made in The U.S.A. by hand for an honest wage. If you are not 100 percent satisfied with your purchase for any reason, please return it for a full refund."

            "We believe what we put on our bodies is as important as what we put in our bodies. This is why we created Everyone Liquid Hand Soap, a gentle and effective EWG verified soap made from our signature blend of organic botanical extracts. Combining soothing organic herbs like calendula, aloe vera, and chamomile with the antioxidants of white tea extracts and vitamins E and B5, you end up with hands that feel nourished, refreshed, and sparkling clean. Just what nature intended. Gentle enough for everyone, and everyday use, our coconut-derived hand soap effectively washes hands, leaving them clean and touchably soft with the subtle scent of pure essential oils. At EO Products, we believe the best resources come from nature. That is why we are committed to our zero-waste mission. Our products are always made with reduction and repurposing in mind, this includes our recyclable packaging. Since 1995, we've made our products from domestic and imported ingredients in our family-owned and -operated factory in San Rafael, California. We learned early on that the only way to meet our own high standards was to take responsibility for everything ourselves. From our family to yours, enjoy."

This Hair Fiber Complex is then fused into our PermaFix Gel to create a flexible matrix, locking the natural color and hairs onto our brows. The results are natural looking, perfectly shaped eyebrows that last for days. Traditional brow pencils, powders can be hard to apply, have multiple steps, can lock unnatural and don't stay in place or last throughout the day. Some women are so desperate to brows they go to the extreme of \"eyebrow tattooing.\" This process certainly lasts but often looks unnatural, is painful and expensive. WUNDERBROW is a new solution which allows women to easily fill, define and shape their brows with natural looking color that lasts until they decide to take it off. WUNDERBROW gives the convenience of the perfect brow, at home, and in one easy step. Permafix Technology locks WUNDERBROW color pigments and fibers onto the skin for up to 3 days without flaking, fading or smudging."

            "THERMAL COSMETIC LIPOSUCTION TECHNOLOGY SLIMMING THERMOLIFTING is a treatment using firming and lifting action of radio waves emitted on skin and to the subcutaneous fat tissue. It causes thermo lipolysis - stimulates the process of burning fat tissue and shrinking adipocytes. Additionally, the treatment stimulates production of new collagen fibers in the skin, thus spectacularly improves its density, tension and resilience. The technology of thermal cosmetic liposuction Thermo-Lift-Slim based on intensely slimming INTENSLIM complex uses the effect of intensive, local body warming and copies the mechanism of exposure to radio waves by fat tissues, thus accelerates its burning. PHASE 1 Stimulates the synthesis of desnutrin - the protein responsible for stimulating lipolysis, that is breaking down gathered fat tissue. PHASE 2 Reduces the volume of fat tissue by reducing inflammation processes and significantly accelerating cell metabolism. PHASE 3 Stimulates formation of new collagen fibers in the skin, thus smoothes its structure and removes advanced cellulite."

            "There's one essential step for achieving smooth skin that shouldn't be overlooked: exfoliation. So, gently buff away dry, dull skin while caring for your skin with Dove Macadamia and Rice Milk Exfoliating Body Polish. Made with \u00bc moisturizing cream, this gentle exfoliating body scrub restores skin's nutrients as it exfoliates, leaving your skin feeling silky smooth. With a smooth, easily spreadable texture, this Dove body exfoliator gives you beautifully creamy coverage while releasing a gently herbal and floral hypoallergenic fragrance. Get all the effectiveness you'd look for in exfoliators or a shower scrub, but with the nourishment and care that your skin needs in the shower. To use, scoop a generous amount of Dove Macadamia and Rice Milk Exfoliating Body Scrub out of the jar. Massage all over your body in circular motions for creamy coverage, and then rinse away to reveal silky smooth skin. Use 3-4 times per week as part of your skin care regimen, followed by Dove Body Wash or Beauty Bar for touchably soft skin. Try Dove Body Polish to get beach-ready skin, prep skin for tanning, or to help exfoliate before shaving to help prevent ingrown hairs."

            "Help treat hair loss and regrow fuller hair with Men's Rogaine 5% Minoxidil Topical Foam. Ideal for use at the early stages of hair thinning, this fast-working hair regrowth treatment is clinically proven to regrow more hair in 12 weeks. Unlike hair loss shampoos and hair thickening products that temporarily plump hair from the outside, Rogaine penetrates the scalp to reactivate shrunken hair follicles, allowing for regrowth of hair. The 5% Minoxidil formula works to boost hair follicle activity and hair protein production, while Tricho-Prime Technology uses a proprietary combination of ingredients to create an optimal environment for hair regrowth. This men's hair re- growth treatment also contains botanical extracts and emollient to help maintain a healthy, conditioned scalp, plus alphahydroxy acid (AHA) to promote natural skin exfoliation to help keep follicles open. It comes in a no-mess foam that is easy to use and is designed to fit easily into your routine."

The unique non detachable oval brush design smooths hair while the rounded edges quickly create volume at the root for beautifully full-bodied bends at the ends in a single pass. The brush is designed with Nylon Pin and Tufted Bristles for detangling, improve volume and control. Styling flexibility is guaranteed with 3 Heat/Speed Settings and a Cool Option. Built to provide just the right amount of heat. Unlike conventional hair dryers, this volumizer can be placed closer to the scalp for lift. Boosted by Ionic Technology hair dries fast and helps reduce heat damage. The One Step Unit is designed for 120V USA outlets only, we do not recommend use of a voltage adapter or converter, as it will damage the unit. Note wattage will vary depending on the location of use."

            "St. Ives Renewing Collagen & Elastin Moisturizer is infused with hardworking collagen and elastin, for a hydrating formula that promotes a youthful glow. Give your skin a daily moisture boost with this facial moisturizer. Made with collagen, elastin and safflower oil, it's safe to use morning and night for smooth, hydrated skin. Now it's easier than ever to nourish your skin with the goodness of 100% natural moisturizers. A lesser known relative of the sunflower, the safflower is a plant with red, yellow and orange flowers. But you shouldn't be deceived by its prickly looking exterior; the plant's oil is known to help to smooth and moisturize skin. Our safflowers come from all over the world, including such countries as Australia and Argentina. The flowers we use are carefully picked and then put through a process which consists of soaking and refining to extract the oil, which is a 100% pure and natural moisturizer too. Youthful skin is always in! This face moisturizer helps renew skin for a beautiful, healthy glow. Collagen and elastin proteins are naturally present in healthy skin. Our nourishing face moisturizer helps you support your body's natural production of these building blocks. To use, apply paraben free face lotion to face and neck, morning and evening \u2014\u00a0and give your skin the TLC it deserves."

            "The statistics are remarkable\u2014nine out of ten pregnant women develop stretch marks at some point in their pregnancy. Some women notice them as early as their first trimester while others not until the end of their pregnancy. And stretch marks are not just limited to the belly where the baby is growing. Thighs, hips, breasts, and buttocks can all show signs of stretching. The cause? The collagen and elastin fibers that keep your skin firm and tight stretch and tear due to the pregnancy hormones and the pressure on your body from the rapid weight gain. While you can\u2019t prevent stretch marks, you can help reduce their appearance with the support from Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula. The Palmer's Complete Stretch Mark Care kit is a pregnancy must have designed specifically for maternity skincare, as it includes a stretch mark cream, a stretch mark lotion, a stretch mark tummy butter, and a skin therapy body oil for stretchmarks and scars. This baby registry gift for a new mom or for yourself is safe to use while pregnant and helps reduce stretch marks as you and your baby grow."

            "St. Ives Renewing Collagen & Elastin Moisturizer is infused with hardworking collagen and elastin, for a hydrating formula that promotes a youthful glow. Give your skin a daily moisture boost with this facial moisturizer. Made with collagen, elastin and safflower oil, it's safe to use morning and night for smooth, hydrated skin. Now it's easier than ever to nourish your skin with the goodness of 100% natural moisturizers. A lesser known relative of the sunflower, the safflower is a plant with red, yellow and orange flowers. But you shouldn't be deceived by its prickly looking exterior; the plant's oil is known to help to smooth and moisturize skin. Our safflowers come from all over the world, including such countries as Australia and Argentina. The flowers we use are carefully picked and then put through a process which consists of soaking and refining to extract the oil, which is a 100% pure and natural moisturizer too. Youthful skin is always in! This face moisturizer helps renew skin for a beautiful, healthy glow. Collagen and elastin proteins are naturally present in healthy skin. Our nourishing face moisturizer helps you support your body's natural production of these building blocks. To use, apply paraben free face lotion to face and neck, morning and evening \u2014\u00a0and give your skin the TLC it deserves."

            "St. Ives Renewing Collagen & Elastin Moisturizer is infused with hardworking collagen and elastin, for a hydrating formula that promotes a youthful glow. Give your skin a daily moisture boost with this facial moisturizer. Made with collagen, elastin and safflower oil, it's safe to use morning and night for smooth, hydrated skin. Now it's easier than ever to nourish your skin with the goodness of 100% natural moisturizers. A lesser known relative of the sunflower, the safflower is a plant with red, yellow and orange flowers. But you shouldn't be deceived by its prickly looking exterior; the plant's oil is known to help to smooth and moisturize skin. Our safflowers come from all over the world, including such countries as Australia and Argentina. The flowers we use are carefully picked and then put through a process which consists of soaking and refining to extract the oil, which is a 100% pure and natural moisturizer too. Youthful skin is always in! This face moisturizer helps renew skin for a beautiful, healthy glow. Collagen and elastin proteins are naturally present in healthy skin. Our nourishing face moisturizer helps you support your body's natural production of these building blocks. To use, apply paraben free face lotion to face and neck, morning and evening \u2014\u00a0and give your skin the TLC it deserves."

            "HOW TO WASH THE HAIR EXTENSIONS",
            "1.Comb your hair with a brush that has soft bristles or a comb with wire pin just before you wash it. This releases any tangles. It is best not to comb from top to ends one time if the hair is a curly style.2.Wet your hair with lukewarm water. Hot water may be more comfortable, but it deteriorates the synthetic hair fibers and shortens the extensions' lifespan.Do not attempt to brush your synthetic hair extensions when they are wet.3.Lather the hair and extensions with a mild shampoo without a bunch of unpronounceable chemicals as ingredients. All-natural is best.4.Rinse the shampoo out of hair extensions. Use a hair conditioner that is very oily, like a deep conditioning treatment. Rinse off 90% but leave just a little in, to prevent tangling.5.Towel-dry your hair as best you can and then allow nature to finish the process. Do not blow dry, this will cause a lot of useless tangles that will ruin your extensions.",
            "HOW TO APPLY THE HAIR EXTENSIONS",
            "1.Divide your hair into two sections. If your hair is very thin, Use a comb to gently tease the lower half of your hair in one-inch sections. This will help keep the extensions securely in place.2.Open the clips on your extensions. Align the tops of the hair extensions with the horizontal part you have made, and gently push down to snap the clips into place. 3.Release the top section of your hair. Gently tousle to blend your natural hair with the clip-on extensions.4.Finish your hair style. Tease your hair at the roots and brush out the top layer so that it is smooth. Your clip-in extensions should be completely blended so that you cannot see them at the roots of your locks.",

Rose petals, which, through distillation, create the rosewater we use in our formula, are full of natural oils and sugars that help restore dehydrated skin and bring out a natural, dewy, glowing complexion. The natural astringent properties of rose petals work in tandem with witch hazel, tightening pores, controlling oil production, locking moisture in, and keeping free radicals out. Rosewater is also full of Vitamin C, which is crucial for collagen production, strengthening skin cells, and fading blemishes and scars. Thayers creates the only Witch Hazel products made of non-distilled extract from the Witch Hazel shrub, maintaining the highest levels of therapeutic tannins, the mild antioxidants that help your skin look and feel its best.

From handles designed for a comfortable grip to pivoting heads that contour to curves, Venus razors are designed to help reveal touchably smooth skin. Venus Extra Smooth women\u2019s razors deliver a close, controlled shave. These razor refills have 5 diamond-like coated blades for an extra smooth shave that lasts. Each blade refill lasts up to one month (based on twice/week shave); just use and replace when you're ready for a new one. These female razor blades cut hair closer to the skin, for a longer-lasting smooth (vs Venus Smooth 3 bladed razor for women). The blade\u2019s water-activated ribbon of moisture helps protect from nicks and cuts. These razor refills have a pivoting head that adjusts to your curves, including ankles and knees. No awkwardly angling your razor. Did you know that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus razor handle (except Simply Venus and Venus Pubic Hair Razor)? Shave your way without buying a whole new Venus handle."

            "Venus female razors for women are designed with a woman\u2019s body in mind. From handles designed for a comfortable grip to pivoting heads that contour to curves, Venus razors are designed to help reveal touchably smooth skin. Venus Extra Smooth women\u2019s razors deliver a close, controlled shave. These razor refills have 5 diamond-like coated blades for an extra smooth shave that lasts. The razor handle is designed with a soft-grip gel to comfortably fit your hands. Each blade refill lasts up to one month (based on twice/week shave); just use and replace when you're ready for a new one. These female razor blades cut hair closer to the skin, for a longer-lasting smooth (vs Venus Smooth 3 bladed razor for women). The blade\u2019s water-activated ribbon of moisture helps protect from nicks and cuts. These razor refills have a pivoting head that adjusts to your curves, including ankles and knees. No awkwardly angling your razor. Did you know that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus razor handle (except Simply Venus and Venus Pubic Hair Razor)? Shave your way without buying a whole new Venus handle.",

            "Gillette Venus Embrace is created with 5 razor blades to hug every curve and get virtually every hair. The result is an ultra-close shave and unsurpassed Venus smoothness."

Built to provide just the right amount of heat. Unlike conventional hair dryers, this volumizer can be placed closer to the scalp for lift. Boosted by Ionic Technology hair dries fast and helps reduce heat damage. The One Step Unit is designed for 120V USA outlets only, we do not recommend use of a voltage adapter or converter, as it will damage the unit. Note wattage will vary depending on the location of use."

            "Inspired by beauty of Pantellerie, where he spent his vacation, Armani created the aroma of Aqua di Gio for men and women. The fragrance for men is a scent of freedom, full of wind and water. The composition is built of a perfect harmony of sweet and salty notes of sea water and nuances of sunny warmth on your skin. Aqua di Gio is full of scorching Mediterranean sun. Bitter citrus with aromatic nuance of rosemary intertwines with salty, sea nuances and pellucid hedione. Sharp notes of spices are softened by woody base with warm, musky trail. It was created in 1996 by Alberto Morillas."

            "The Panasonic er430k vacuum ear/nose trimmer is the ultimate personal grooming tool. Have you ever wondered where hair clippings go after they have been trimmed from your ear or nostrils? some fall into the groomer but many remain right where you found them. They can fall out at inappropriate times or be inhaled. The er430k uses a revolutionary vacuum system to whisk away cut hairs so that they remain out of sight. The sleek ergonomic design makes it easy to hold and position. The hypoallergenic blades on the er430k are placed at a 60 degree angle so they cut cleanly and precisely without the pulling that can occur with a duller blade. It equipped comes with a mirrored cap to help locate stray hairs. The head rinses clean under running water. Operates on one double aa battery."

            "The Panasonic er430k vacuum ear/nose trimmer is the ultimate personal grooming tool. Have you ever wondered where hair clippings go after they have been trimmed from your ear or nostrils? some fall into the groomer but many remain right where you found them. They can fall out at inappropriate times or be inhaled. The er430k uses a revolutionary vacuum system to whisk away cut hairs so that they remain out of sight. The sleek ergonomic design makes it easy to hold and position. The hypoallergenic blades on the er430k are placed at a 60 degree angle so they cut cleanly and precisely without the pulling that can occur with a duller blade. It equipped comes with a mirrored cap to help locate stray hairs. The head rinses clean under running water. Operates on one double aa battery."
