            "Twinings Irish Breakfast Black Bagged Tea. Pack of 100 tea bags. Enjoy one of your favorite tea flavors with this set from Twinings. This set of 100 tea bags comes in the Twinings Classics Irish bagged breakfast tea flavor. Twinings Irish Breakfast tea pays tribute to the Irish, who are well-known for their love of strong teas. It is naturally caffeinated to help keep you awake and to start your day off right. This blend combines teas carefully selected from four distinct regions to give it added body, flavour and strength. The bold taste originates from teas grown in the tropical climate of Assam and the rich, amber color from teas grown in the fertile terra rossa soil of Kenya. The hardiness from these regions is complemented by the softer and more subtle teas from Indonesia and China to yield a full-bodied tea with a smooth finish."

            "Do you remember old-fashioned, buttered popcorn? Like the popcorn you can still get at movie theatres? We do. In fact, we used to make it. It was heavy on buttery topping and other artificial flavors. Our fans asked us for something with less topping, but with that same great taste, and we came up with Skinny Pop - skinny on ingredients! SkinnyPop starts with a premium popcorn kernel, sunflower oil and the perfect amount of salt. From there, Pure Popped Perfection says it all. Our popcorn has no GMOs, gluten or preservatives, making SkinnyPop a tasty, guilt-free snack. We believe in snacking without compromise. To us, that means using the fewest, cleanest and simplest ingredients possible to bring you the best tasting popcorn. Popcorn is a whole grain food - it contains the entire kernel. Because of this, it is high in fiber, rich in nutrients and has a low glycemic index. There is \"no artificial anything\" in our products - meaning we do not add any artificial or synthetic ingredients, colors, flavors, or preservatives to them. \u2013 That\u2019s the Skinny!"

            "CONTENTS:STORMIO: A rich & strong coffee blend. Intensity 8. Smooth, rich cereal notes are brought to the fore by Guatemalan washed Arabica, which are then blended with Nicaraguan beans to create a strong, distinct flavor. tormio is mainly comprised of dark and long roasted beans, which help to develop its intensity, both in terms of body as well as singular notes. A long prewetting and high temperature allow to express the spicy and woody notes of Stormio.ODACIO: A long bold & lively coffee blend. Intensity 7. An audacious blend of fine Arabicas from Nicaragua and Ethiopia, Odacio is a full-bodied coffee with cereal notes accented by a slight East African fruitiness. Adding milk softens the flavor, bringing dairy, sweet notes. Fusing the flavors of two different continents, this blend of fine Arabica beans from Central America and East Africa serve up contrasting, yet complementary tastes in Odacio. MELOZIO: A smooth & balanced coffee blend. Intensity 6. Fine quality Brazilian Bourbon and Central American Arabicas are lightly roasted to create a rounded coffee that is smooth and perfectly balanced. Adding milk opens up the softer, sweeter sides of the coffee, enhancing the biscuity notes. Central American Arabica coffee delivers balance and a harmonious character to Melozio, which is enhanced by the sweet, honey notes of fine Brazilian Bourbon coffee beans. Thanks to the split-roasting, the fine Brazilian Bourbon beans reveal flavors rich in sweet cereal notes, giving a sensuous, smooth texture. The soft character and balance is achieved through the second split of Central American Arabicas. The fast flow and high temperature ensure a roundness of flavor, which is typical in blending lightly roasted Bourbon and Central American Arabicas."

            "Adolph Levis sold pickles, relishes, sausages, and other popular snacks and condiments from his basement in Philadelphia during the Great Depression. But these foods just weren't the easy, spicy treat that bar patrons craved. Levis experimented with different ways to serve sausages, eventually experiencing a Snap moment of his own when he developed a cured beef sausage that would curb consumers' cravings. Printed on the jars the beef sticks were sold in was a little tuxedoed man, complete with top hat and cane. Levis named him \"Slim Jim,\" and the now-famous spicy snack was born. Early advertisements for Slim Jim touted \"the ready-to-eat spiced sausage treat\" that was packed in cellophane and sold for a dime.",

If you're more into eating a couple of these chewy treats on their own, you'll be ready to go the second you open the container. Keep your pantry stocked with kosher-certified, low-fat TWIZZLERS Twists candies, store some in your work desk, take a container on a road trip and bring a pack to your next party gathering. Looking for an even greater adventure? For a unique twist, melt several white or milk chocolate bars. Dip your TWIZZLERS candies in the melted gooiness, then cover each piece in sprinkles and let the new treats cool!"

            "Trident Lime Passion Fruit Twist Sugar Free Gum is a fruity and delicious way to get fresh breath and protect your teeth. It's bursting with citrus flavor for tang. Passion fruit flavor for passion. Twisted for your enjoyment. With 30% fewer calories than sugared gum, Trident fruit flavored gum is sweetened with xylitol, a naturally occurring sugar alcohol. The ADA Council on Scientific Affairs found that the physical act of chewing Trident sugarless gum for 20 minutes after eating stimulates saliva flow which helps to prevent cavities by reducing plaque acids and strengthening teeth. Bulk gum packs give you plenty of Trident lime passion fruit gum to stock your business, or use these packs of passion fruit Trident gum to pass out as party favors or Halloween treats. Each individual pack of gum is designed so the passion fruit gum stays inside, making it easy to toss in your car, backpack or desk drawer. These sticks of fruit gum are individually wrapped for extra freshness."

            "The Bigelow Tea Story Beginning the moment our founder, Ruth Campbell Bigelow created \"Constant Comment\" Tea in her kitchen in 1945, our family has focused on just one thing trying to make the finest teas possible. Over the years we have introduced many new flavors as well as concepts in tea. Today we offer a selection of deliciously different blends of teas and green teas, a wide variety of herbal teas and teas flavored with real fruit juice. Today Bigelow Tea is the number one specialty tea company in the United States. And to think it all began with the first legendary black tea flavored with golden orange rind and sweet spice \"Constant Comment\"Tea. Bigelow takes immense pride in providing the tea drinking community with the best tea at a great value. We only use hand- picked teas, real spices, flavors and herbs. The flavors and blends we have created are second to none. Some of our teas contain up to twenty different ingredients! And because tea is a leaf that can dry out we take steps to protect it. To keep the teas fresh, we seal our tea bags in protective packets. We simply have to protect those delightful flavors. That's why a cup of Bigelow Tea is aromatic and delicious; a true indulgence for the senses."

It\u2019s enough to satisfy the entire family! Share a bag on family movie night, bring it to the soccer game for a snack or toss a bag in the car for when the whole gang is hungry.

            "Available in a variety of delicious fruit flavors, Stur water enhancers are the liquid drink mix for consumers looking for natural ingredients. Delicious, naturally flavored water can now be made at home or on the go with our portable liquid drink mix bottles.  To use, flip-open the cap. Point downwards directly into your water. And squeeze 1 second per serving in 8-ounces of water (squeeze longer to add more flavor)! Each portable bottle of Stur makes 20 8-ounce drinks \u2013 with 0 sugar, 0 calories, and 100% Vitamin C per serving.  The Stur brand is about helping others to love water naturally. Stur was born while my wife was pregnant with our twin girls. The doctor had recommended she drink 8-10 glasses of water a day. But like most Americans, she wasn't drinking even half of that! So I started looking for healthy ways to flavor her water. I went to the store and searched the drink mixes, but found that they were all made with artificial chemicals that we didn't feel comfortable putting in my wife's body. Finally I asked a food scientist friend to help me create a liquid blend of natural fruit flavors and natural stevia leaf extract to squeeze in water. It took us over a year and hundreds of different formulations to land upon a blend that tasted better than most bottled sugary drinks (and we're still tinkering to perfect it)! I called our special blend \"Stur\" and proudly wrote on our hand-drawn label that it had 0 calories, 0 sugar, essential vitamins, and NO artificial sweeteners, colors or flavors. (That initial label was hand-drawn by yours truly, and by popular demand, it has since been replaced with a more professional one!). Just like so many others, I hope you love Stur as much as we have put love into making it. If for any reason you aren't satisfied, just let us know --- we will make it right."

Our zesty blend of lemon and ginger has been combined with the probiotic BC 30, an innovation that helps maintain a healthy balance in your digestive tract when used as part of a balanced diet. About the Brand The Bigelow Tea Story Beginning the moment our founder, Ruth Campbell Bigelow created \"Constant Comment\" Tea in her kitchen in 1945, our family has focused on just one thing; trying to make the finest teas possible. Over the years we have introduced many new flavors as well as concepts in tea. Today we offer a selection of deliciously different blends of teas and green teas, a wide variety of herbal teas and teas flavored with real fruit juice. Today Bigelow Tea is the number one specialty tea company in the United States. And to think it all began with the first legendary black tea flavored with golden orange rind and sweet spice; \"Constant Comment\"Tea. Bigelow takes immense pride in providing the tea drinking community with the best tea at a great value. We only use hand-picked teas, real spices, flavors, and herbs. The flavors and blends we have created are second to none. Some of our teas contain up to twenty different ingredients! And because tea is a leaf that can dry out we take steps to protect it. To keep the teas fresh, we seal our tea bags in protective packets. We simply have to protect those delightful flavors. That\u2019s why a cup of Bigelow Tea is aromatic and delicious; a true indulgence for the senses."

            "People go nuts for PBfit and here\u2019s why: they don\u2019t expect it to taste as good as regular peanut butter. So when it does, they get super excited, even a bit obsessed. Imagine snacking on peanut butter that has about one-third the calories and 87% less fat than other nut spreads. That means guilt-free smoothies, baked goods, peanut butter dips, pancakes, oatmeal \u2014 you get the idea. Made with real roasted peanuts, this nut butter powder provides the classic peanut butter taste that your whole family loves. Because PBfit peanut butter powder is non-GMO, vegan, dairy-free, soy-free, and gluten-free, it can be enjoyed by nearly everyone. Betterbody Foods PBfit is made by gently roasting peanuts and then pressing the peanuts to extract the majority of the oil from those peanuts. This process reduces the unnecessary fats that are found in regular peanut butters, but it still leaves a delicious, low-fat peanut butter powder that is chock full of flavor. PBfit is recognized for award-winning taste by ChefsBest\u00ae. Products must earn the ChefsBest\u00ae Excellence Award by surpassing quality standards established by professional chefs. To make a low-fat peanut butter spread, mix 2 tablespoons of dry PBfit with 1.5 Tablespoons of water. PBfit is packaged at BetterBody Foods' World headquarters in Lindon, Utah."

            "La Tourangelle Toasted Sesame oil is pure, all-natural and handcrafted from high-quality sesame seeds harvested from South America or Africa. The seeds are toasted and then expeller (machine) pressed to extract the oil. This oil is filtered several times and then bottled. Our mill slowly roasts the sesame seeds using lower temperatures. The result is a deep amber, richly flavored oil with a subtle toasted taste. Sesame Oil has long been the universal cooking medium in Asia, imparting the characteristic flavor to the foods of its regions. In Chinese and Korean cuisine, it is added as a flavor highlight to cooked dishes. The Japanese often add about 10% toasted Sesame Oil to the oil used for tempura or deep-frying, creating a rich, background flavor. American cooks may want to use Sesame Oil to flavor an Asian stir-fry or noodle dish or as a marinade for meat or fish. Sesame Oil, rice vinegar, fresh grated ginger, and mustard is a delicious dressing for any combination of salad greens. Sesame Oil, is an ancient ingredient. The Assyrians used it as a cooking oil more than 600 years before Christ. It was expensive, however, and a hundred years later in Persia only the rich could afford it. It is still used as a medicine in India , and oil pressed from the raw seed is a massage oil in Ayurvedic medicine. Its low saturated fatty acid content and high unsaturated fatty acid content makes it a very healthy oil. La Tourangelle is one of few remaining oil mills keeping a time-honored French heritage of roasting and pressing nut kernels into delicious oils. We are a family-owned company whose mastery of oil production is the fruit of passion, integrity, and pride. We strive to be the best artisan oil producer, dedicated to making carefully crafted, sustainable, natural products. With artisan care, we extract the seeds' essence and hidden natural treasures to create amazing products that bring delight in the kitchen and well being for the body."

            "It was 1925 in the flourishing Italian community of san Francisco. Rinaldo and ezilda torre blended their first torani Italian syrups using authentic recipes brought from Lucca, Italy. The enterprising couple shared their naturally flavored syrups throughout their north beach neighborhood. Mixing their rich torani syrups with sparkling water and ice, they introduced the classic Italian sodas to cafe owners. This bright, refreshing creation quickly caught on with thirsty customers. In time, torani' s reputation for creating syrups of the highest quality and greatest variety grew. Today, torani is the best-selling specialty syrup in north America and a sign of good taste around the world. What began as five traditional Italian flavors has expanded to more than 80 naturally flavored syrups and a host of creative flavoring ingredients. Each torani product is still made using only the finest ingredients and a careful blend of all-natural extracts. For the finest ingredients and beverage creativity, reach for torani."

            "People go nuts for Organic PBfit and here\u2019s why: they don\u2019t expect it to taste as good as regular peanut butter. So when it does, they get super excited, even a bit obsessed. Imagine snacking on peanut butter that has about one-third the calories and 87% less fat than other nut spreads. That means guilt-free smoothies, baked goods, peanut butter dips, oatmeal \u2014 you get the idea. Made with real roasted peanuts, this nut butter powder provides the classic peanut butter taste that your whole family loves. Because Organic PBfit peanut butter powder is non-GMO, USDA organic, dairy-free, soy-free, and gluten-free, it can be enjoyed by nearly everyone. Betterbody Foods PBfit is made by gently roasting peanuts and then pressing the peanuts to extract the majority of the oil from those peanuts. This process reduces the unnecessary fats that are found in regular peanut butters, but it still leaves a delicious, low-fat peanut butter powder that is chock full of flavor. PBfit is recognized for award-winning taste by ChefsBest\u00ae. Products must earn the ChefsBest\u00ae Excellence Award by surpassing quality standards established by professional chefs. To make a low-fat peanut butter spread, mix 2 tablespoons of dry PBfit with 1.5 Tablespoons of water. PBfit is packaged at BetterBody Foods' World headquarters in Lindon, Utah."

Our balanced coffee is set apart by its refined taste, persistent character, and intense aroma.

Suitable for all 44mm ESE coffee machines. Back in the late 1700s, Naples was the first city in Italy, the second in Europe and the fifth in the world.

Caff\u00e8 Borbone was born in 1998 and since then has been a constant source of innovation and inspiration, experimenting with new technology to bring the unique and inimitable taste of Neapolitan coffee to the world!

            "These versatile seeds will add nutrition and a rich nutty taste to any meal! Sprinkle Hemp Hearts on salad, cereal, or yogurt, or blend them into smoothies. Shelling the hemp seed produces the most nutritious and tender part of the seed, the heart. Hemp Hearts taste great, are easy to use, and nutritious too! There\u2019s no need to grind or cook Hemp Hearts, they\u2019re ready to eat straight from the bag and are simple to incorporate into your diet. Try sprinkling them on salads, cereal, or yogurt or blend them into smoothies. The only limit is your imagination. Hemp Hearts may look little, but they contain 10 grams of Plant Based Protein and 10 grams of Omega-3 and Omega-6 per 30 gram serving (more than a comparable serving of flax or chia). Manitoba Harvest is the world\u2019s largest hemp food manufacturer to grow, make and sell our own line of hemp foods. Our producer partners deliver whole seed directly to our state-of-the-art, BRC (the highest level of food safety and quality certification in the world) certified facility.

            "Haribo, founded in 1920 in Bonn, Germany by Hans Riegel, is one of the most prominent manufacturers of sweets (namely fruit gums, licorice, and foam) in the world. The company name is an acronym for \"Hans Riegel, Bonn\" and stands as a reminder of Haribo's continuing loyalty to early traditions. After Hans Riegel died during World War II, his son, also named Hans Riegel, took over the factory and expanded its operations, taking over many local confectionery manufacturers in countries all over the world. Currently, Haribo operates five factories in Germany and 13 throughout the rest of Europe. The company also has sales offices in almost every country in Europe as well as in the Unites States. Haribo's German catch phrase is \"Haribo macht kinder froh / und Erwachsene ebenso,\" which translates as \"Kids and grown-ups love it so / the happy world of Haribo.\""

Over the years we have introduced many new flavors as well as concepts in tea. Today we offer a selection of deliciously different blends of teas and green teas, a wide variety of herbal teas and teas flavored with real fruit juice. Today Bigelow Tea is the number one specialty tea company in the United States. And to think it all began with the first legendary black tea flavored with golden orange rind and sweet spice\u0085\"Constant Comment\"\u00aeTea.",
            "Bigelow takes immense pride in providing the tea drinking community with the best tea at a great value. We only use hand- picked teas, real spices, flavors and herbs. The flavors and blends we have created are second to none. Some of our teas contain up to twenty different ingredients! And because tea is a leaf that can dry out we take steps to protect it. To keep the teas fresh, we seal our tea bags in protective packets. We simply have to protect those delightful flavors. That\u0092s why a cup of Bigelow Tea is aromatic and delicious; a true indulgence for the senses."

            "Green Tea is pretty simple. It\u2019s Green Tea. What makes ours so special is that we use only hand-picked tea from high elevation gardens and then we gently process it, bringing out that natural flavor people have been enjoying for centuries. Our tea is not harsh, not too grassy but smooth and very delicate... easy to drink. Enjoy the whole cup.",
            "About the Brand",
            "The Bigelow Tea Story Beginning the moment our founder, Ruth Campbell Bigelow created \"Constant Comment\" Tea in her kitchen in 1945, our family has focused on just one thing trying to make the finest teas possible. Over the years we have introduced many new flavors as well as concepts in tea. Today we offer a selection of deliciously different blends of teas and green teas, a wide variety of herbal teas and teas flavored with real fruit juice. Today Bigelow Tea is the number one specialty tea company in the United States. And to think it all began with the first legendary black tea flavored with golden orange rind and sweet spice \"Constant Comment\"Tea. Bigelow takes immense pride in providing the tea drinking community with the best tea at a great value. We only use hand- picked teas, real spices, flavors and herbs. The flavors and blends we have created are second to none. Some of our teas contain up to twenty different ingredients! And because tea is a leaf that can dry out we take steps to protect it. To keep the teas fresh, we seal our tea bags in protective packets. We simply have to protect those delightful flavors. That's why a cup of Bigelow Tea is aromatic and delicious; a true indulgence for the senses."

From the very first sip, illy's rich, fragrant aroma and distinctive, consistent taste provide an authentic Italian coffee experience to be savored over and over again. illy produces one single blend composed of nine types of 100% premium Arabica coffee--the very finest--and makes it available in different formats and roasts. This choice guarantees consistent quality and distinguishes the illy blend, ensuring it always has the same unique aroma and flavor. The green coffee beans are carefully selected at source from the best plantations in Brazil, Central America, India and Africa and are then subjected to 114 quality control steps before being sold. The coffee is packaged in the signature illy can which provides a protective pressurized atmosphere to preserve its aroma for two years. Brewed coffee made with an autodrip machine is the most popular preparation method in the United States, and waking to a steaming cup of this smooth, aromatic elixer is a morning ritual for many. Using the proper grind is essential for a rich, aromatic, never-bitter taste, which is why illy ground coffee for drip coffeemakers was created. It is more coarsely ground for optimal extraction with drip coffeemakers and French presses. illy's decaffeinated coffee has the same flavor profile as medium roast, but without the caffeine.8.8 ounces"

Wedderspoon believes that Mother Nature knows best, which is why we don\u2019t process, age, heat, or manipulate our KFactor honey. We allow our bees to roam freely through remote terrain on New Zealand's South Island and feast on wild Manuka blossoms, then we cream our honey fresh so it tastes like Manuka should. The result is Manuka honey brimming with a unique and creamy taste and full of living enzymes and antioxidants to empower your daily wellness."

            "The cold and rainy weather and hardened persona made a strong morning brew a perfect fit for Ireland. While having existed for centuries, there is no exact formula for loose Irish Breakfast Tea, rather it is a blend of assorted teas. U.S. Wellness uses lighter single estate leaves, due to their varied altitudes, have various taste pallets. Located just off the southern tip of India, Sri Lanka is small, about the size of West Virginia. Surprisingly, given its land mass, it is one of the largest tea producers in the world, and tea is its largest industry. This blend of Irish Breakfast tea uses all 100% organic Ceylon tea. Ceylon is the general classification name given to loose black teas that are grown and cultivated in Sri Lanka. It is known as the world\u2019s best fruity black tea, which makes it excellent for making tea blends such as this. One of the contributing factors to the prominence of tea in Sri Lanka is their unique production method. While once a country dedicated to coffee, after a series of ecological setbacks, combined with the prominence of the British in their land, they turned to tea as their newest cash crop. They made their name in tea through meticulous workmanship, using the Orthodox method to produce all of their teas. Over the ensuing years, various new processes have come along that \u2018modernize,\u2019 tea making, but many of these give up quality and taste for efficiency. Methods such as CTC manufacturing are no doubt faster, but the Sri Lankans have pride in their work, and have stood by the slower but delicate Orthodoxy. The Orthodox method means filling baskets a little at a time before emptying, to avoid any minor bruising that too much weight can cause."

            "About the Brand",
            "Around the turn of the 19th century, during the reign of King George III, the recipe for the original Altoids was perfected by Smith & Company, a London confectionary firm. They were first sold in the U.S. in 1918, at that time sold in small, rectangular cardboard cartons. The tins so recognizable today were first introduced in the 1920s to help protect the mints and to stay neatly closed in pockets and handbags.",
            "Today, the Altoids line includes mints, sours, and gum.",
            "Why Are They Called Altoids? The exact origin of the name is unclear, but it seems that during the 19th century confections were given names employing the -oids suffix to imply a medicinal benefit (Altoids were promoted for more than a century as a \"stomach calmative,\" though of course Altoids provides no medicinal benefit). Smith & Company also marketed several other remedies with \u0096oids in their names, such as Benoids for delicate throats and chests, Zenoids for an easy digestion, Cyphoids to defend your throat, and Notoids antiseptic voice and throat pastilles.",

            "Ghee is a type of clarified butter that is heated, reduced & triple-filtered out and what you\u2019re left with is the pure healthy fat, which is lactose free & dairy free, good for digestion and metabolism. It is an iconic ingredient and food staple with a history as rich as its taste. It originates in India and is used extensively in cooking and to promote health. Ghee alone is an excellent alternative to butter for those who are lactose intolerant and who want the taste of butter, without the disadvantages of processed margarines. Unlike other oils it is rich in butyric acid, a short chain fatty acid that is great for your overall health and digestion. Ghee\u2019s buttery taste and high smoke point (485 degrees) makes it an excellent addition to your everyday cooking oils, is extremely easy to cook with and delicious simply spread on a piece of toast. Fourth & Heart grass-fed ghee uses the highest quality grass-fed butter sourced from a cooperative of farms in New Zealand. Grass is naturally high in Vitamin A, D, E, K and CLA. When the cow\u2019s milk is rich with these vitamins it goes directly to the butter and therefor the ghee. Replace your everyday butter & oil with\u00a0Grass-Fed\u00a0Pure Spreadable Butter. Please note: ghee naturally melts at approximately 90-degrees farenheit, which can occur during transit and delivery. This is perfectly normal and will not damage the ghee, which will resolidify if left at room temperature or refrigerated for 2-3 hours."

            "There's no better way to \"go organic\" than with our milk. We work with a co-op of smaller dairy farms that always pay careful attention to the well-being of the cows and feed them a 100% organic diet - that's good news for the cows. Supporting organic products, like milk, helps encourage organic agriculture. Organic farming prohibits the use of persistent pesticides and genetically engineered seed to help protect the land and water supply - that's good news for the earth. Our milk is never ultra-pasteurized. Though it shortens the life of each carton, we believe using traditional, lower heat pasteurization gives our milk its delicious, wholesome flavor - that's good news for you. Pour a glass. Change the world."

We know how to unlock the power of the hemp seed better than anyone because we take a seed-to-shelf approach, controlling the quality in everything from what hemp seed gets planted to how products are manufactured, packaged, and distributed. Our producer partners deliver whole seed directly to our state-of-the-art, BRC (the highest level of food safety and quality certification in the world) certified facility.

            "Taras old-fashioned caramels are made from a century-old family recipe that has not changed. We still cook each batch slowly to achieve a deep caramel flavor and rich caramel color. Each piece is twist wrapped in parchment paper and shipped to you in a stay-fresh, resealable jar. This means you can snack or share at your own pace. Taras recipe calls for real butter, fresh cream, and pure vanilla extract. We buy these ingredients locally and combine them in kettles to make our premium caramel. We\u2019ve been selling these caramels across the nation for a long time. Some of the most common responses we hear are: \u201cThese taste just like my Mom\u2019s.\u201d; \u201cI\u2019ve never had anything like this from a store.\u201d; \u201cThese are so much better than I expected.\u201d Taras Caramels are a great gift to yourself or someone else because they will genuinely surprise and delight the recipient through craft quality."

            "The original rich and deliciously creamy non-dairy creamer. Perfect anytime you want to enjoy a velvety-smooth cup of coffee. \"About our Brand\" COFFEE-MATE was the first to transform an ordinary cup of coffee into a creamy treat and remains the leading innovator in the non-dairy creamer category. In 1961, COFFEE-MATE was introduced as the world\u2019s first non-dairy powdered creamer. COFFEE-MATE soon established its position as America's most popular non-dairy creamer. This favored status was strengthened with the introduction in 1989 of NESTLE COFFEE-MATE liquid, which quickly became the number one non-dairy liquid creamer on the market, a position it still holds today. NESTLE COFFEE-MATE sets the pace for the entire coffee creamer industry through its regular introduction of new and exciting flavors that keep consumers interested in turning \"kitchen coffee\" into \"cafE coffee.\" Over the past couple of decades, COFFEE-MATE has transformed how consumers enjoy their coffee through the introduction of dozens of new flavors, Special Edition and Seasonal flavors and reduced fat, fat free and sugar free varieties in both powder and liquid."

They stay fresh until you open a pack so you can eat a couple without opening a whole box.",
            "From the Manufacturer",
            "BRAND STORY",
            "The Walkers story begins over a hundred years ago in 1898 in the Scottish Highlands, when the twenty-one year old Joseph Walker opened the doors of his own bakery with a loan of \u00a350 and the dream of making the finest shortbread in the world. In the first year of business, Joseph used every spare moment to perfect his shortbread recipe, and it was time well spent.",
            "As his fame spread, and demand increased for his quality shortbread, Joseph took the first steps to expanding the business by moving to a larger shop in the Speyside village of Aberlour and investing in a horse and cart to deliver his baking further afield.",
            "During the 30s, the business - like Joseph's family - was expanding. Two of his sons - James and Joseph - joined the business, bringing fresh, new ideas with them. By 1936, they had introduced three valuable additions to the business: a range of cakes, a selection of confectionery - and the company's first delivery van. Now Walkers produce could be sold even further afield, and the prospects for expansion were looking promising.",
            "While some manufacturers began to cut corners by using margarine instead of butter, Joseph believed that people still appreciated the care that went into making a superior product like Walkers shortbread. And he was right. That's why, even after Joseph Walker died in 1954, his sons continued to use his original recipe.",
            "Demand grew, and so did the business. By 1961, all three of James' children - Joseph, James and Marjorie - had joined the business, making the third generation of Walkers working for the family firm. By 1975, Walkers had outgrown their extended bakery, and moved to a custom built factory that gave them the extra space and facilities they needed to develop new products such as Chocolate Chip Shortbread and specialty cookies.",
            "By the 1970s, Joseph's grandchildren had begun exporting Walkers shortbread to over 60 countries around the world - still baking to his original recipe. Within a decade, they won the first of three Queen's Awards for Export Achievement - the highest accolade given to British exporters.",
            "Then, as now, Walkers stayed in touch with their customers by testing every new product in Aberlour's village shop. So, customers around the world are enjoying a range of products that were first given the seal of approval by the villagers of Aberlour. Consistent quality and traditionally delicious recipes have made Walkers the choice of the most discerning customers and retailers.",
            "Walkers reputation grows day by day as loyal customers worldwide delight in traditional shortbreads and innovative new products like almond, ginger and luxurious chocolate covered shortbread. All Walkers' products are packaged in its unmistakable red tartan and proudly bearing the image of Bonnie Prince Charlie and Flora MacDonald, the image which captures one of the most romantic moments from Scotlands history, and reflects all the tradition and care that goes into baking every piece of Walkers shortbread.",
            "The quality and natural goodness of Walkers has attracted many international awards, including five gold Mondiale medals and the Food from Britain Innovation Award.",
            "While Joseph's children and grandchildren have moved with the times, they have always remained true to his original ideal - and his original recipe. So, when the family opened a new factory at Elgin to produce their popular new range of shortbread cookies and biscuits, they naturally still insisted on using only the finest ingredients: plump fruits, aromatic spices, chunks of real chocolate and flavorsome nuts. And there's not an artificial flavoring, coloring or preservative in sight. Just as Joseph Walker guaranteed all those years ago.",
            "Today, Joseph would be proud to know that his great grandchildren are carrying on the family tradition and are now the fourth generation of Walkers to make 'The world's classic pure butter shortbread'."

            "Made from antioxidant-rich, sustainably farmed ginger, our 99% pure ginger juice is fresh pressed and flash pasteurized to retain valuable, healthy compounds found in fresh ginger. Also known as High-Temperature Short-Time Pasteurization (HTST), flash pasteurization is a delicate, short heating process to eliminate microorganisms and extend shelf life, yet maintain flavor, heat and the healthy actives in ginger. With no sugar or water added, our not-from-concentrate juice is balanced with citric acid. Bursting with fresh, spicy ginger flavor. Unsweetened, unfiltered, unadulterated. No artificial ingredients, non-GMO, vegan and gluten free. Pure goodness! Drink straight as a daily wellness shot or to flavor and boost drinks, like wellness shots, detox tonics and workout recovery drinks. For health and wellness, in sparkling water, smoothies, fruit juice and tea. For cooking, in rice, stir fry, grilled fish and homemade dressings. Popular in daily wellness shots, smoothies, homemade kombucha and flavored water for detox, The Ginger People Ginger Juice is a convenient alternative to juicing fresh ginger at home. Save your knuckles and your time with our quick and easy, ready-to-pour ginger juice. Using a proprietary juicing process to retain valuable actives found in fresh ginger, The Ginger People Ginger Juice contains an average of 17mg 6-gingerols and 3mg 6-shogaols per fluid ounce. Gingerols, a cluster of natural compounds found in fresh ginger, benefits gastrointestinal mobility (rate food exits the stomach during the digestive process). Ginger encourages efficient digestion, so food doesn't linger as long in the gut. With heat treatment, gingerols are transformed into corresponding shogaols. Gingerols and shogaols exhibit a host of beneficial actions, ranging from anticancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-allergic, to various central nervous system activities. #1 IN GINGER: After nearly 40 years in the ginger business, The Ginger People remains family-owned and still focused on the goodness of its favorite spice. Inspired by the healing powers of ginger spanning over 5000 years, The Ginger People is committed to bringing great-tasting products to consumers worldwide to support overall health, wellness and well-being."

            "Peet's Coffee Major Dickason's Blend, Dark Roast, Single Serve K-Cup Coffee Pods for Keurig Coffee Maker; A loyal customer of our original Berkeley store, retired army sergeant Key Dickason brought the idea for our most beloved blend to Mr. Peet in 1969. Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet decided naming it after his friend wasn't enough-Dickason's rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major. Major Dickason's combines the best origin coffees from the world's premier growing regions, each imparting its distinctive regional characteristics while still effortlessly rounding into a smooth, balanced cup. Over the years, it has become the coffee that epitomizes Peet's: flavorful, deeply roasted, and unsurpassingly satisfying. But for us, \"Major D\" is just like a relationship with an old friend. We'll always remember it as the story of a customer's passion, an expert's palate, and a shared love of coffee."

            "One of the best artisanal French salts, Sel Gris is a great gourmet salt that comes in varying shades of grey. Harvested by hand from clay-lined salt ponds in the Gu\u00e9rande region of France, Sel Gris is a crunchy crystalline salt that retains much of its natural moisture. Though a classic in French cuisine, the mild flavor pairs nicely when cooking and baking a wide variety of foods, from soups and salads to cookies, and is one of the most popular salts for seasoning on homemade chocolate caramels."

Next we use the perfect recipe of spices passed down by generations of sausage makers. These spices complement our meats, ensuring that they enhance the natural flavors while never overpowering them. We use no binders, fillers or extenders\u2014just enormous care to ensure that our sausages are always mouthwateringly delicious. We hand craft our meats into a variety of shapes and sizes before we begin the smoking process. We smoke all of our meats slowly over real hardwood fires in our traditional pit style smokehouse to ensure natural flavor. We leave them hanging for as long as it takes until we're satisfied with the flavor. After we smoke our meats, we pack them immediately to seal in the freshness and flavor. Quality control procedures are in place at every step of the process, and goods are stored under optimal temperatures to maintain freshness and quality. But our products rarely sit around. We ship to retailers all across the country, allowing everyone to experience the true taste of Wisconsin."

            "Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors 80% lean ground beef comes from whole muscle steak cuts, meaning we dont use trimmings at all like the majority of ground beef. We use a low pressure chopping method whic preserves the coarse texture preventing over grinding and provides a better taste over all other ground beef. Whether used to make the best hamburgers, meatballs, sauce, there is nothing better than Pat LaFrieda ground beef. Pat LaFrieda 80/20 is made of premium blends of chuck, shoulder clod and brisket from Black Angus cattle which are humanely raised on farms in the USA."
