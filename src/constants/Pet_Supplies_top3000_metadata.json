            "Pamper your pet with a Furhaven Two-Tone Faux Fur & Suede L Chaise Dog Bed! A luxuriously soft faux fur sleep surface is complemented by suedine bolsters and gusset. Ultra plush, flecked faux fur provides a snuggly soft sleep surface and trims the edges of the bolster for a chic flair. The two-tone design hides dirt and pet dander better than traditional plush sleep surfaces. The L-shaped bolsters support your pet\u2019s back and hips, providing additional support. The L-shape also provides the perfect nook for pets that like to nest into comfort. The two raised, rounded bolster ends allow your pet to lay their paws or neck on the pillowed edge, helping to align the neck and spine. The medical-grade foam core includes a layered orthopedic foam core topped with gel-infused memory foam. Micro gel beads help keep the bed cooler while memory foam conforms to your pet's shape providing superior support of joints and pressure points. Gel foam has cooling properties reducing the sleeping surface by 1 or 2 degrees, wicking heat away from your pet. The superior support provided by both foam cores will help your pet reach a deeper, more restorative rest for your pet's health. Available in various stylish colors and diverse sizing options so your pet can sprawl and lounge the day in maximum comfort and style. Easy to clean. Cover care: Remove from core before washing (see seam label for fabric care instructions). Foam care: Cooling gel foam is highly absorbent. Spot clean with mild soap or enzyme-based cleaning spray. Rinse but DO NOT SOAK OR SUBMERGE. Press out moisture with a dry towel and air dry. A fan may be used to speed drying. Do not wring or place in machine dryer. Dry completely before use. Not for unsupervised use by animals with destructive chewing behavior."

Unlike other flea and tick protection, Seresto flea and tick collars kill and repel fleas for eight continuous months. Seresto flea and tick collars are recommended by veterinarians, stocked by 8,000 vet clinics* and have been trusted by pet owners for nearly a decade. Seresto collars make your pet's comfort a priority by killing on contact, so pests don\u2019t have to bite your dog or cat to die. Existing fleas die within 24 hours of application. Re-infesting ticks die in as few as six hours, and tick infestations are eliminated within 48 hours of the initial application. Seresto collars are also effective against chewing lice and aid in the treatment and control of Sarcoptic mange. There\u2019s no prescription needed for Seresto collars. Seresto is a trademark of Elanco or its affiliates. *Elanco Animal Health, data on file"

Inspired by a dog\u2019s powerful sense of smell, we developed a long-lasting durable chew that\u2019s jam-packed with real peanuts. Once your dog takes a bite of our USA-made chews, he\u2019ll be hooked.",
            "We\u2019re Obsessed with Safety Too",
            "Wonder if Benebone is right for your dog? Here\u2019s what you need to know. Since it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s important that your pup has strong teeth. If you\u2019re unsure, check with your vet. Nobody likes an unexpected trip to the dentist. Keep an eye out for wear and tear. Within a month or so, we find that most dogs chew Benebone into submission. See the wear page on our website for helpful photos to determine when to replace yours. Keep away from households with peanut or other allergies.",

Providing a full month of protection, it begins working in minutes, killing 98-100% of the fleas on cats within 12 hours, and 99% of flea larvae within 20 minutes.

In fact, Advantage does such a good job breaking the flea's life cycle, there's no need to treat your cat's environment. Applied before the start of flea season, it helps keep your cat from becoming infested in the first place. Used year-round, it prevents fleas from over-wintering in your home to feast on your cat the next season. Safe for kittens as young as eight weeks and as small as nine pounds, Advantage is also water-resistant. This package includes 4 pre-measured doses in easy-to-use applicator tubes.",

            "If your dog lunges and jumps when he sees squirrels (and sniffs other dogs), the Gentle Leader Headcollar is the perfect solution for teaching better leash manners. Use this training tool for your most determined puller while still allowing him full range of motion to bark, eat, drink and play fetch. The Gentle Leader Headcollar loops around your dog\u2019s nose instead of his neck or shoulders like other harnesses. This means when your dog pulls, the headcollar gently moves his head toward you so he can refocus his attention on you and away from the tempting squirrels and distracting smells. The best part is, once your dog is a champ at walk etiquette, you will probably only have to use the headcollar as a backup during situations when you need a little more control, like vet visits or dog park play dates. This headcollar is vet recommended, trainer designed and dog parent trusted. If you accidentally purchase the wrong size, or if your dog mistakes his headcollar for a chew toy, our Customer Care experts are happy to assist with replacements or resizing. Your pet deserves the best. Trust PetSafe to help keep your pet healthy, safe and happy."

            "Training Pads are ideal for puppies and dogs that stay indoors for long periods of time. What you should do; Unfold the training pad and place it in a confined area. (Blue plastic side down). It is important to place your puppy or dog on the training pad several times a day in order to get him used it. on the average, a puppy must relieve himself every few hours, based on his age (a 2 month old puppy every 2 hours, a 3 month old every hours etc). If your pet relieves himself somewhere other than the designated spot where the pad is placed, bring him back to the correct spot immediately. Keep in mind that your pet will have to relive himself shortly after a meal and will need to eliminate more frequently during the summer when his water intake is higher. The minute your dog begins to relieve himself on the pad, be sure to use cures like \u201cgo potty\u201d. You should use this cue every time that your dog relives himself on the pad so that he associates the phrase with the action of elimination. Every time that your pet used the pad successfully, make sure that you give him a treat and lots of praise. Treating helps your dog to understand that he is doing what you want him to do. Always remember to dispose of soiled pads and replace them as needed. When your pet begins to relieve himself on the pads, on consistent basic, it is time to begin moving the pad closer to the door. Keep moving the pads closer to the door until they are actually outside. At this time, the training process will be complete."

            "Veterinary Formula Clinical Care Antiparasitic and Antiseborrheic Medicated Shampoo for Dogs is an effective and affordable treatment for skin scaling caused by seborrhea, mange and other parasitic infections, and fungal infections. With an easy treatment regimen of shampooing 2-3 times per week initially and then less frequently as skin improves, you can give your pet relief from symptoms including an inflamed scalp, greasy skin, rashes, and scaly skin similar to dandruff that are caused by seborrhea (most commonly caused by bacterial or yeast infections). The veterinary-grade ingredients in our topical bottle of antiseborrheic and antiparasitic shampoo for dogs help treat, hydrate and relieve multiple skin conditions such as seborrhea, mange, parasitic and bacterial infections. Powerful ingredients like salicylic acid, coal tar and micronized sulfur help treat the condition, while colloidal oatmeal and allantoin hydrates skin and promotes healing. You can also use this antiparasitic mange shampoo for dogs with other topical spot-on flea and tick treatments. Great for pets with allergy-prone and yeasty skin! We know that your dogs are more than just pets - they are part of the family - so Veterinary Formula Clinical Care designs premium medicated products that pet parents can actually afford. Your dog will feel fast acting relief from skin infections and you\u2019ll notice that your dog\u2019s skin is calmer, less inflamed and the itching is controlled \u2013 making you both happy and able to focus on more important things like walks, fetch and snuggles. It\u2019s important to determine the cause of the underlying issue, so please consult your veterinarian if skin issues become a consistent problem. Due to the coal tar content of this shampoo, we do not recommend its use on cats."

            "If your cat has had fleas, there\u2019s a chance they have tapeworms too. Tapeworm segments look similar to grains of white rice and are visible when stuck in your cat\u2019s hair under the tail or by the back legs or in their poop. It\u2019s not always obvious that your cat has tapeworms, so the best way to identify a problem is through an exam performed by a veterinarian. Use Bayer Tapeworm Dewormer for Cats to treat your pet. Cats' everyday grooming behavior puts them at risk for ingesting fleas, which means a risk of tapeworms. Fleas can carry immature tapeworms, and they are the main source of tapeworm infections in cats. A cat that has been infested by fleas may develop tapeworms. Outdoor cats that hunt small rodents may be at risk of infection from tapeworms as well. In addition to treating with tapeworm dewormer, take steps to control fleas and rodents on the premises in order to prevent reinfection; Otherwise another round of the tapeworm dewormer for cats will be necessary. This is especially true in cases of tapeworms transmitted by fleas where reinfection is almost certain to occur if fleas are not removed from the animal and its environment. Consult your veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosis, treatment and control of parasitism. Keep away from children."

Existing fleas die within 24 hours of application while reinfesting fleas are killed within just two hours \u2013 before they lay eggs \u2013 preventing further flea infestation. Re-infesting ticks die in as few as six hours, and tick infestations are eliminated within 48 hours of the initial application. Seresto Small Dog collars protect against common pests like deer ticks, American dog ticks, brown dog ticks, and Lone Star ticks; they\u2019re also effective against chewing lice and aid in the treatment and control of Sarcoptic mange. Fleas and ticks not only cause discomfort; they can also transmit bartonellosis, tapeworms or Lyme disease. Check the product label for information on potential side effects.",

            "The Easy Walk Harness is a no-pull dog harness that helps stop pulling and teaches him better leash manners. The Easy Walk Harness has been loved and trusted by millions of pet parents and trainers since 2004 to help improve walks around the world. Since this harness rests across your dog\u2019s chest, you won\u2019t have to worry about it putting pressure on your dog\u2019s neck like when he wears a standard collar. The patented martingale loop on the front of the harness makes this harness great for dogs who pull. As your dog pulls or lunges, the specially designed loop tightens, putting gradual pressure on your dog\u2019s shoulders, allowing you to help redirect their focus. The leash attaches to the front of the harness so you can help gently guide your dog. Your dog will be cool and comfortable while wearing his harness. The Easy Walk Harness has less coverage than other harnesses making it lightweight and very breathable. The harness is also incredibly durable and ready for every walk or hike. The Easy Walk Harness is quick and easy to fit. We\u2019ve made the belly strap a different color from the rest of the harness, so you\u2019ll be able to easily put on your dog\u2019s harness for your next walk together. You can purchase the Easy Walk Harness risk-free because whether the harness isn\u2019t the right size or your dog mistakes the harness for a chew toy, our Customer Care team is happy to assist you with a new size or replacement. You and your dog will soon enjoy pull-free walks together. Trust PetSafe to help keep your pet healthy, safe and happy."

Unlike other flea and tick protection, Seresto Small Dog flea and tick collars kill and repel fleas for eight continuous months. Seresto Small Dog flea and tick collars are recommended by veterinarians, stocked by 8,000 vet clinics* and have been trusted by pet owners for nearly a decade.",
            "Seresto Small Dog collars make your dog\u2019s comfort a priority by killing on contact, so pests don\u2019t have to bite your dog to die. Existing fleas die within 24 hours of application while reinfesting fleas are killed within just two hours \u2013 before they lay eggs \u2013 preventing further flea infestation.

            "The Outward Hound Granby Dog Life Jacket is a high-performance dog flotation device for boating, water sports, the beach, the pool, and other water adventures with dogs. Designed with novice swimmers in mind, the neoprene side panels of this dog life vest will keep your dog safe by providing them with comfortable buoyancy and thermal insulation for chilly days on the water. A front neck float adds extra support to help them keep their head above water. Top grab handles provide an easy way to retrieve your dog in an emergency. Adjustable straps keep them secure both in and out of water. For small dogs, sizes XS and small come with one top handle, and for larger dogs, sizes medium-XL come with dual rescue handles. Since dogs come in various shapes and sizes, please select the appropriate dog life jacket size after taking your dog's girth measurement along the widest part of your dog's rib cage. Make sure to take any other unique traits (i.e., large shoulders, long torso) into consideration. The Dawson dog life vest is available in multiple colors to fit your dog's personality! SAFETY AND CARE: This is a flotation aid intended for use on a conscious dog in calm waters. Use rescue handle to lift dogs in emergencies only. Do not leave dog unattended while using this product.

            "PILL POCKETS TURN PILL TIME INTO TREAT TIME. GREENIES Pill Pockets Treats for Dogs make it easy to give your dog medicine, with a tasty chicken flavor they\u2019re sure to love. Why hide your pet\u2019s medicine in human foods like peanut butter or cheese when you can give them a healthy all natural dog treat, made with natural, real ingredients plus trace nutrients instead? Designed by veterinarians, GREENIES Pill Pockets Dog Treats mask the smell and taste of any medicine, taking the stress (and mess) out of giving your canine companion medicine. Whether for large breed or small dogs, these smaller-sized Pill Pockets for capsules make taking medicine a positive experience for your dog. And they\u2019re easy to give: Simply drop a capsule into the Pill Pockets pouch, pinch the top half closed, give it to your pup, and poof: Watch their medicine disappear. GREENIES Pill Pockets are the ingenious way to give your dog their meds\u2014and they\u2019ll never know the difference. * Data on file at Mars Petcare US, Inc. 2018"

        "description": [
            "Want the secret to a healthy saltwater aquarium? The API SALTWATER MASTER TEST KIT accurately measures four saltwater parameters that are key to keeping your aquarium healthy - ammonia, pH, nitrate, and nitrite. It includes six bottles of liquid test reagent, four glass test tubes with snap-tight caps, a holding tray and a step-by-step instruction booklet with information on how to correct unsafe water conditions. With API MARINE FLAKES Fish Food you can feed your Clownfish, Wrasses, Damsels, Tangs and other marine fish a protein-rich diet scientifically formulated to promote healthy growth and clean, clear water. Overfeeding, low palatability and low quality lead to unconsumed or poorly digested food which causes waste and raises ammonia levels. High levels of ammonia are toxic to fish and can cause gill damage, stress, illness and even fish loss. The increased digestibility of API MARINE FLAKES produce up to 30% less ammonia than leading competitors and contain high-quality ingredients, such as spirulina algae and Omega-3 fatty acids to aid in overall healthy fish growth. The more nutrients your fish digests, the less waste and ammonia are released, leaving clean, clear water. With API aquarium products, it\u2019s easy to keep a beautiful saltwater, freshwater or reef aquarium. For almost 60 years API has developed premium solutions with proven and effective results for your family and ours. API offers a range of testing kits, water conditioners, and nutritionally superior food, because we\u2019re dedicated to making a better underwater world. They work to provide a safe, hospitable environment for fish such as tropical community fish, cichlids, goldfish and more. At API, we understand the rewards and relaxation of fishkeeping because we have a passion for fish too."

            "Bathe your dog with the name you trust. Arm & Hammer uses the power of baking soda to refresh a stinky coat and eliminate odor. The baking soda dissolves into fine particles, getting into hard to reach areas, resulting in a deeper clean. This shampoo will make bath time a pleasant experience for you and your pet and is safe to use with topical flea and tick treatments. Our odor eliminator spray for dogs is a combination of odor eliminators and a fresh kiwi blossom scent to work hard on one job: getting rid of even the smelliest odors. Our formula is gentle enough for all dogs and puppies to use, and leaves behind a sweet smell that they'll love! It is effective whether you need to eliminate wet dog odor (use liberally and comb through gently) or if you need to deodorize dry dog scent (for short-haired dogs, spray the Arm & Hammer deodorizing spray into your hand then lightly massage into the coat). This product works on virtually any dog--even dogs with sensitive skin--and it is made with all natural ingredients. This comes with 6, 8 oz bottles of our super deodorizing spray for pets. DIRECTIONS: Spray dog from back of ears to tail, carefully avoiding eyes. Massage into coat. Repeat as necessary. Can be used on wet or dry fur. For external use only. INGREDIENTS: Water, Coconut Based Surfactants, Sodium Bicarbonate, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Honey, Rosmarinus Officinal (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Verbena Officinalis Flower Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Yogurt Extract, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, DMDM Hydantoin. WARNINGS: For external use only. Safe for dogs 8 weeks of age and older. Avoid contact with eyes. Keep out of reach of children."

            "A safe and long lasting alternative to chewing real wood sticks, Dogwood by Petstages has all the taste and texture of a natural tree branch, but will last much longer and won\u2019t splinter and make a mess as your pup chews. With a variety of scents like the smell of real wood or a Mesquite BBQ, Dogwood combines real wood with synthetic strength, making it a tough and durable chew toy. This alternative chew toy is a treat for letting your dog work out their destructive chewing. It is equally suitable for some outdoor play time to seal that dog and owner bond. Made in the USA, Dogwood chewable wooden toys for dogs are safe, long lasting, and are a great way of training your dog out of destructive chewing behaviors. SAFETY AND CARE: Petstages chews are non-edible and are meant for dogs only. As with any chew toy, we always recommend monitoring your dog's use and replacing after reasonable wear, no toy is indestructible. Remove if excessive consumption occurs or pieces larger than a piece of rice are chewed off. Know your dog\u2019s chewing habits and teeth strength, your pet\u2019s safety is your responsibility. For additional safety information, please visit our Petstages safety page to review our suggested 10 Chew Commandments."

This premium white bedding is so plush your pet will love burrowing deep into it \u2014 it's like sleeping in a soft, white cloud. And you'll have peace of mind knowing this high-quality paper bedding is safe for you and your pet. The cloud-like texture is just the beginning of what makes this bedding stand out. Kaytee Clean & Cozy White Bedding is made from super soft, premium paper. In contrast, many products use an inferior paper by-product known as \"sludge.\" Because we use paper that doesn't contain harmful chemicals or by-products, you can rest easy knowing your pet will be both cozy and safe. It's paper you would feel comfortable using, so you'll feel comfortable letting your pet nest and burrow in it too. Using high-quality paper means our White bedding is highly absorbent \u2014 it absorbs six times its weight in liquid and expands to three times its size. Plus, it's easy to scoop and discard. Absorbent bedding gives you peace of mind knowing your pet won't develop respiratory issues from a smelly habitat. Instead, your pet will sleep soundly in comfy bedding that's 99.9% dust free. And our premium, super-absorbent bedding is odor-control guaranteed."

This elevated feeder accommodates small, medium, and large dogs by adjusting from 2.75 inches; to 8 inches; to 12 inches high. It grows with your dog from puppyhood to their adult years! When not in use, the legs can be easily removed and tucked under the feeding platform for easy storage and dog travel accessories. Set up the raised feeder when needed, then put it away for a neater, clutter-free space. The Designer Diner includes two stainless-steel, rust-resistant bowls that are dishwasher safe for easy cleaning and maintenance. The legs of the stylish frame are outfitted with non-slip pads to prevent tipping and skidding, and the spill ridge on the raised dog bowl keeps food and water off of the floor."

            "A lot can happen in a week, but smelling your cat\u2019s litter box shouldn\u2019t be one of them. Our patented-formula ARM & HAMMER litter can absorb, seal, and destroy cat litter-box odors on contact and is effective enough to be used in a multiple-cat litter box. Moisture-activated Micro-Granules form a tight seal around odor and destroy it, while the litter helps create rock-solid cat litter clumping. With 10% more cat-odor eliminators plus ARM & HAMMER baking soda, your kitty\u2019s box can stay fresh for up to 14 days. This ARM & HAMMER cat litter is easy to use and change. Simply fill 3\u20134 inches of your kitty litter box, scoop away the clumps, and refill the box back to the 3\u20134-inch mark. Empty your litter box into the garbage only when it is time to change the box. At ARM & HAMMER we respect all living things, especially animals and pets because they rely on us. We focus on product quality and customer satisfaction while embracing a corporate duty to respect the environment and natural resources."

            "The Life Stages folding metal dog crate by MidWest Homes for Pets includes all of the features you will need to provide a convenient, safe & secure pet home for your best friend, from puppy to adulthood. This crate includes a divider panel allowing you to adjust the size of the living area as your puppy grows. The plastic leak-proof pan allows easy clean-up in the event of an accident. A strong plastic carrying handle is included for convenient portability, and rubber feet on the bottom of the crate protect the floors inside your home. We recently enhanced the safety and security of the Life Stages crate by adding locking tips on the slide-bolt latches to securely lock the door and patented Paw Block, which prohibits your dog from tampering with the door lock from the inside. MidWest Life Stages crates also feature patented rounded side clips that reduce possible sharp points to ensure a safe experience for you and your pet. Every Life Stages metal dog crate conveniently folds down flat for travel. The 30\" Life Stages (model 1630) measures 30L x 19W x 21H inches and is suitable for \"medium\" dog breeds. **Please note the term \"medium\u201d breed is subjective. For the best fit, we advise that you check the measurements of the dog crate and select a size that will be suitable for your dog's ADULT weight and measurements. Your dog should be able to comfortably sit upright, lay down, and easily turn around inside the crate. When in doubt, we suggest you purchase a larger crate option. We at MidWest Homes for Pets understand that your dog is a part of your family; that's why we ensure our dog crates are manufactured with the highest quality control standards to create a safe and secure home for your pet. Assembly and safety instructions are included; please read all safety instructions prior to use."

            "Is your cat peeing outside the litter box, scratching your furniture and carpet, or hiding on a regular basis? These behaviors may be caused by fear or anxiety. FELIWAY products are a vet recommended, drug free, and clinically proven to help alleviate many of the unwanted behaviors cat owners deal with. FELIWAY Spray provides \u201chappy messages\u201d by mimicking the natural feline reassuring messages (pheromones) to make cats feel calm and comfortable at home. This product has been found to reduce scratching, spraying, and hiding for 90% of cats, and many owners see results within 7 days. Cats are also very sensitive to change, so if you anticipate changes in the home (moving, renovation, recorating, new pets, new family members, etcs.), FELIWAY is very effective in helping your cats remain calm, and adapt to the changes without unwanted behaviors. If you are having issues with spraying (peeing), after cleaning urine-affected areas, spray FELIWAY directly onto the urine marks, as well as onto other prominent objects including furniture, drapes, window frames and doorways. This helps your cat to feel calm, and reduces unwanted behaviors caused by anxiety (like peeing outside the litterbox). This will also help them to stop scratching and hiding as well. Feliway Spray is completley safe for both humans, and your cat - it is odorless and colorless. Spray away the fear, and feel calmer today!"

            "ARM HAMMER Slide Platinum clumping cat litter is our most advanced ARM HAMMER cat litter with patented EZ Clean technology to give you a nonstick, clumping cat litter odor-control product that is perfect for single- and multiple-cat households. Our Platinum formula has 10% more odor eliminator than our ARM HAMMER Slide Non-Stop Odor-Control Cat Litter, and those powerful odor eliminators combine with ARM HAMMER baking soda to destroy odors on contact. Plus, the Clump Seal technology forms an odor-containing seal around urine and feces, so odors are caught and contained before they can leave the litter box. When it comes time to clean the litter box, this clumping litter forms rock-hard clumps and slides right out of the pan, so cleaning up after your cat (or cats) is no problem at all. For over 165 years, people have trusted the ARM HAMMER brand for a range of versatile, effective household products. In 1992, they introduced their signature cat litter, made with odor-absorbing baking soda, to give pet parents an effective solution for litter box odor."

            "PILL POCKETS TURN PILL TIME INTO TREAT TIME. GREENIES Pill Pockets Treats for Dogs make it easy to give your dog medicine, with a tasty real peanut butter flavor they\u2019re sure to love.

Designed by veterinarians, GREENIES Pill Pockets Dog Treats mask the smell and taste of any medicine, taking the stress (and mess) out of giving your canine companion medicine. Whether for large breed or small dogs, these smaller-sized Pill Pockets for capsules make taking medicine a positive experience for your dog. And they\u2019re easy to give: Simply drop a capsule into the Pill Pockets pouch, pinch the top half closed, give it to your pup, and poof: Watch their medicine disappear. GREENIES Pill Pockets are the ingenious way to give your dog their meds\u2014and they\u2019ll never know the difference. * Data on file at Mars Petcare US, Inc. 2018"

            "Help cats with varied personalities live in harmony with pheromone therapy. The Feliway MultiCat 30-Day Starter Kit diffuses clinically proven synthetic cat appeasing pheromone throughout your home. This synthetic pheromone mimics the natural pheromone a mother cat produces when kittens are born, reducing tension between cats and ultimately promoting a more harmonious home. The Feliway MultiCat 30-Day Starter Kit helps curb your cats' stressful responses to cat conflicts and introducing new cats/kittens. Use Feliway MultiCat diffusers in areas your cats frequent to help control unwanted behaviors including standoffs, stalking or chasing, biting, hissing, growling, spitting, or fleeing. The synthetic cat appeasing pheromone in this formula communicates a reassuring message to your cat, which helps curb or eliminate unwanted behaviors.",
            "Manufacturer's Notice",
            "1)Behaviorists recommend one litter box per cat plus one. Where are they located, they should be spread all over the house, not placed in just one room. Is there a food and water bowl per cat, but not located near each other. 2)The product will last up to 30 days. If it lasted 27-30 days this is within the expected duration of use. The variation depends on the ambient temperature, humidity and air flow present in the house or where the diffuser is placed. 3) All pets respond to pheromones, but the degree to which they respond is determined by many factors. How severe is the stress the cat is experiencing currently (it is easier to prevent than treat), has there been any positive changes to the environment (adding extra resources like litter boxes and food bowl), what are the cat's previous experiences (if one cat had a bad experience with a housemate they may have learned not to trust other cats)."

            "Is your cat peeing outside the litter box, scratching your furniture, or hiding on a regular basis? These behaviors may be caused by fear and anxiety. FELIWAY products are vet recommended, drug free, and shown to help alleviate many of these unwanted cat behaviors. FELIWAY CLASSIC provides \u201chappy messages\u201d by mimicking the natural feline reassuring messages (pheromones) to make cats feel calm and comfortable at home. This product has been found to reduce scratching, spraying, and hiding for 90% of cats - many owners see results within 7 days. Cats can be sensitive to change, so if you anticipate changes in the home (moving, renovation, new pets, etc.), FELIWAY is effective in helping your cats remain calm, and adapt to the changes without unwanted behaviors. This FELIWAY Classic Diffuser Refill kit includes three refill vials (diffuser sold separately). Plug your diffuser in the room(s) where your cat spends most time - each diffuser covers up to 700 sq. feet. Make sure your diffuser isn't covered by curtains or behind furniture. Each refill can last up to 30 days. For maximum effectiveness, you should replace diffuser every 6 months. Follow the instructions when plugging in diffuser, and plug it in upright."

        "description": [
            "Cozy comfort with a cooling twist! Pets who love to burrow under the covers enjoy the Furhaven Microvelvet Snuggery Dog Bed. This bed features a soft extra layer of fabric over the sleep surface that can be used as traditional burrow \"blanket\" or (by inserting the provided flexible hoop) as a private \"cave\" for your pet. Private, snuggly and stylish, the soft microvelvet fabric will blanket your pet in comfort while the cooling gel top foam core soothes them to sleep. Our laminated gel foam top pet bed core features gel-infused memory foam that is pressure-activated to absorb your pet's body heat and disperse it away from their body to provide a cooling effect. Just like traditional memory foam, the gel top foam will conform to your pet's unique shape to provide the best support for joints and to relieve pressure points. We pair the benefits of cooling gel memory foam with a medical-grade polyurethane foam base to maximize its benefits and ensure the best support for your pet. All foam used in the manufacture of this product is made in the USA and has been certified and rigorously tested to ensure it meets standards for content, emissions and durability by CertiPUR-US. Easy to clean. Cover care: Remove from core before washing (see hang tag and/or seam label for care instructions). Foam care: Cooling gel foam is highly absorbent. Spot clean with mild soap or enzyme-based cleaning spray. Rinse but DO NOT SOAK OR SUBMERGE. Press out moisture with a dry towel and air dry. A fan may be used to speed drying. Do not wring or place in machine dryer. Dry completely before use. Not for unsupervised use by animals with destructive chewing behavior."

            "The Chuckit! Kick Fetch ball is designed to get both pets and pet parents moving for fun, interactive play. Each time pet parents kick the Chuckit! ball, the deep-grooved design creates a random, exciting bounce, satisfying dogs' chasing instincts. For quick and easy retrieval, the ball's curved grooves allow dogs to get a secure grip for comfortable carrying. Featuring a canvas, rubber, and foam construction, these strong dog toys are durable for tough play outdoors and float for dogs that enjoy playtime by the water. The bright orange and blue design grabs dogs' attention in the air and can be easily spotted in tall grass, on water, or in the dog toy bin. For pets that are active at night, a glow-in-the-dark Max Glow version is available, requiring as little as five minutes of charging under bright light for 20 minutes of illuminated play. Offered in small and large sizes, a wide range of dogs enjoy fetch with the Chuckit! Kick Fetch ball, making it an excellent addition to your dog toy box"

            "Making the Switch to Purina ONE: Although you'll be anxious to see the difference Purina ONE can make in your cat, please allow 7(en)10 days to ease the transition from your cat's current food. Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more Purina ONE until you're feeding Purina ONE exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. Adult Cat Feeding Instructions: Fill your cat's bowl with the recommended measured amount every morning and allow your cat to eat on a (l\") free choice (r\") basis throughout the day, rather than as a single feeding at mealtime. Food intake required to maintain an ideal body condition will vary, depending on age, activity and environment. Monitor your cat's weight and adjust food amount accordingly. Fresh Water, Proper Diet and Veterinary Care: Be sure to provide fresh water in a clean container for your cat daily. Proper diet, exercise and veterinary care are the best ways to keep your cat healthy. If your cat hasn't had a checkup in the past year, please make an appointment today. No Supplements Necessary: Purina ONE provides 100 percent complete and balanced nutrition for the maintenance of adult cats. There is no need to add vitamins, minerals, or other supplements, unless specifically directed by a veterinarian. Feed Only One: A cats' digestive system works best when it receives the same food each day. Although humans crave variety in their diets, cats do not. Feeding different cat foods can turn your cat into a finicky eater. Avoid feeding table scraps, as they can upset the nutritional balance provided by your cat's regular food, and may lead to obesity. For questions related to the health of your cat, see your veterinarian. It's Not for All Cats: Purina ONE Hairball Formula is specifically formulated for adult cats. If you have a kitten, or a pregnant or nursing cat, feed Purina ONE Healthy Kitten Formula. Store in a cool, dry place.:",
            "Kitten Feeding: Kittens generally nibble solid foods at 3 4 weeks of age. Keep moistened Purina ONE available to these kittens at all times. After weaning, at 6 8 weeks of age, kittens will normally eat dry or moistened food at will. If water is added, use no more than one part warm (not hot) liquid to three parts Purina ONE, changing frequently to ensure freshness. Food intake required to maintain ideal body condition will vary, depending on age, activity and environment. Monitor your kittens' weight and adjust food mount accordingly. Making the Switch to Purina ONE: Although you'll be anxious to see the difference Purina ONE can make in your cat, please allow 7 10 days to ease the transition from your cat's current food.

No Supplements Necessary: Purina ONE provides 100 percent complete and balanced nutrition for the growth of kittens and reproducing females in stages of gestation and lactation. There is no need to add vitamins, minerals or other supplements, unless specifically directed by a veterinarian. Feeding for Reproduction: Purina ONE provides all the nutrients needed during reproduction. It is not necessary to add supplemental vitamins or minerals. Food consumption can vary during gestation. Feed the amount needed to maintain ideal body condition in the pregnant female. After the kittens are born, feed the nursing female all she wants to eat.

            "Help retrain unwanted behaviors like jumping up, barking, food stealing and place training with Pet Corrector. Pet Corrector is favorited by pet parents and dog trainers worldwide and has become a must-have for retraining bad habits like excessive barking and jumping up. Pet Corrector works by emitting a harmless hiss sound, that mimics warning sounds found from other animals like snakes, geese, racoons and other animals. This sound interrupts their actions and gives time to help retrain \"quiet\" \"no jump\" and \"no barking\" techniques. We love our dogs so training them humanely is important. Pet Corrector is a positive and respectful way to interrupt bad habits & retrain positive actions for peace of mind around the house and in public. When training to prevent excessive dog barking, or to stop your dogs from barking at strangers, we suggest using Pet Corrector in short bursts and never pointing Pet Corrector at your dog, or aiming Pet Corrector at a place on your body. Pet Corrector is strongly discouraged for use with Puppies and should be used at a safe distance from your dog- never to be pointed directly at your dog or close in proximity to their body."

Made from evaporated sea water and containing natural active ingredients such as a natural fish tonic, API AQUARIUM SALT promotes the overall health of your fish by improving their gill function and reducing stress in a freshwater aquarium. This all-natural salt provides the essential electrolytes fish need for the uptake of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide and ammonia through the gills. API AQUARIUM SALT should only be added to reduce stress during new freshwater aquarium setup and water changes or to promote disease recovery when solving specific fish health issues. Use API AQUARIUM SALT when setting up a new freshwater aquarium, when changing water or treating disease. Make sure to take extra care when using salt with live plants, as some plants may be sensitive. With API Aquarium products, it\u2019s easy to keep a beautiful saltwater, freshwater or reef aquarium.

            "For over 25 years, Fancy Feast has been committed to preparing the most enjoyable gourmet meals for your cat. Our quest for culinary perfection is a pursuit to bring love and joy along with balanced nutrition.",
            "Feasting Done Right",
            "Feed an average size adult cat one can per three pounds of body weight daily. Feed up to twice this amount to kittens. Pregnant or nursing cats may require two to four times their normal feeding. Variety is the spice of life, and that's why we suggest serving your cat Fancy Feast Gourmet Wet Food as well as Dry. For cats who are fed both wet and dry food, adjust your feeding routine to maintain a healthy body condition as instructed by your veterinarian.",

            "We know that nutrition is just one component of providing a cat with a long, happy, healthy life. That's why we work hard to help cat owners learn to nourish their whole cat: mind, body, furry coat, and paws alike. Providing your cat with complete nourishment and care starts with understanding what she needs. Here's an overview of the essentials for helping your cat to thrive.",

            "Two tiers, two times the fun! The Multi-Tier Pet Fountain has an upper and lower bowl for your pet to drink from, keeping them happy and hydrated. Pets love running water and are drawn to it. Pet fountains entice pets to drink more water which keeps them healthy and hydrated. With this fountain, pets can drink from the flowing stream or from the bowl tiers (which is awesome) because your pet needs 1 ounce of water per 1 pound they weigh every day. The water constantly circulates which keeps things fresh and helps to promote good pet hygiene. The levels of this fountain make this great for pets of all sizes since they can drink water at a height that\u2019s comfortable for them. This is especially great for senior pets, so they won\u2019t have to bend down as much to drink from the upper tier. This fountain works hard to make sure your best friend will have fresh water. A carbon filter and fountain pump work together so your pet will always have clean water to drink. We\u2019ve made this fountain easy to clean \u2013 simply place the fountain in the top rack of the dishwasher and hand wash the pump separately. Your pet deserves the best. Trust PetSafe to keep your pet healthy, safe and happy.",

            "Two tiers, two times the fun! The Multi-Tier Pet Fountain has an upper and lower bowl for your pet to drink from, keeping them happy and hydrated. Pets love running water and are drawn to it. Pet fountains entice pets to drink more water which keeps them healthy and hydrated. With this fountain, pets can drink from the flowing stream or from the bowl tiers (which is awesome) because your pet needs 1 ounce of water per 1 pound they weigh every day. The water constantly circulates which keeps things fresh and helps to promote good pet hygiene. The levels of this fountain make this great for pets of all sizes since they can drink water at a height that\u2019s comfortable for them. This is especially great for senior pets, so they won\u2019t have to bend down as much to drink from the upper tier. This fountain works hard to make sure your best friend will have fresh water. A carbon filter and fountain pump work together so your pet will always have clean water to drink. We\u2019ve made this fountain easy to clean \u2013 simply place the fountain in the top rack of the dishwasher and hand wash the pump separately. Your pet deserves the best. Trust PetSafe to keep your pet healthy, safe and happy.",

            "Is your cat peeing outside the litter box, scratching furniture, or hiding on a regular basis? These behaviors may be caused by fear and anxiety. FELIWAY products are vet recommended, drug free, and shown to help alleviate many unwanted behaviors cat owners deal with. FELIWAY CLASSIC provides \u201chappy messages\u201d by mimicking the natural feline reassuring messages (pheromones) to make cats feel calm. This product has been found to reduce scratching, spraying, and hiding for 90% of cats - many owners see results within 7 days. Cats are also very sensitive to change, so if you anticipate changes in the home (moving, renovation, recorating, new pets, etc), FELIWAY is effective in helping cats remain calm, and adapt to changes without unwanted behaviors. The FELIWAY Classic Diffuser Refill includes one refill vial (diffuser sold separately). You should plug your diffuser in the room(s) where your cat spends most time - each diffuser covers up to 700 sq. feet. Make sure your diffuser isn't covered by curtains or furniture. Each refill can last up to 30 days. For maximum effectiveness, you should replace your diffuser every 6 months. Make sure to follow instructions when plugging in your diffuser, and plug diffuser in upright."

            "The Comfy Cone is a soft, cone-shaped e-collar that helps your pets heal and recover from surgeries, procedures, allergy flare-ups and hot spots in comfort.",
            "All Comfy Cones are made with foam-backed, padded nylon that is easy to clean and is water-resistant and repellent. The tight gauge of the nylon even prevents cats from getting their claws into the material! The Comfy Cone uses Velcro for tight closures, making it easy to get the cone on and off animals quickly. And the cone can be reversed inside and out, as well as front to back to support shoulder and upper back injuries.",
            "The Comfy Cone comes with three sizing strips that let you adjust the size of the cone for a secure fit. Use the Sizing Chart and Measuring Guide above or on our website to determine the right size for your pet.",
            "Along with the sizing strips, each cone comes with removable plastic stays that let you determine how structured the cone should be for your pet. Remove the stays for a more flexible cone and keep them in for firmer structure, like when a pet has had eye surgery. Once the stays are removed, the Comfy Cone can even be folded back for added freedom while eating and drinking or when checking wounds and irritations. All Comfy Cones have a reflective edge for safety and elastic loops at the neck to thread your pet\u2019s collar through.",
            "It\u2019s perfect to use during recovery as well as during playtime at home or at the park!",
            "DISCLAIMER: The Comfy Cone is an alternative to a plastic cone and as with any medical devices, please supervise your pet when they are wearing it. It\u2019s best to purchase an authentic, new Comfy Cone for your pet. All Four Paws cannot approve of the condition or function of any Comfy Cone not purchased new and directly through an authorized retailer."

            "Tougher than real sticks and flavored with real maple wood, the Maplestick is sure to upgrade your pup\u2019s chew and fetch game. About Benebone At Benebone, we started with the premise that dogs experience scent and flavor in a way we can\u2019t even grasp. So we ditched the neon colors and loud squeaks. Inspired by a dog\u2019s powerful sense of smell, we developed a long-lasting durable chew that\u2019s jam-packed with real maple wood. Once your dog takes a bite of our USA-made chews, he\u2019ll be hooked. We\u2019re Obsessed with Safety Too Wonder if Benebone is right for your dog? Here\u2019s what you need to know. Since it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s important that your pup has strong teeth. If you\u2019re unsure, check with your vet. Nobody likes an unexpected trip to the dentist. Keep an eye out for wear and tear. Within a month or so, we find that most dogs chew Benebone into submission. See the wear page on our website for helpful photos to determine when to replace yours. Keep away from households with peanut or other allergies. What\u2019s Inside? Nothing but Nylon and Real Wood for Tantalizing Flavor"

            "Behind the Nature\u2019s Miracle formula is a family that loves their pets. In 1981, the Original Nature\u2019s Miracle product (intended for use in preschools), was used by founder Joe Weiss to clean-up a pet accident. To his surprise, the formula worked quickly to remove the stain and the odor. Pleased with the success, Joe produced 24 bottles of Nature\u2019s Miracle \u201cPet Mess Easy Clean-up.\u201d The new cleaner sold out in 48 hours! Pet owners discovered that the formula was incredibly effective at removing their pet\u2019s stubborn stains and odors, and Nature\u2019s Miracle Stain and Odor Remover was born. Today, Nature\u2019s Miracle remains one of the top pet-mess cleanup solutions for pet owners everywhere.",

            "Advantus flea chews for dogs are a fast-acting dog flea treatment of flea infestations. Advantus 30 count chewable flea treatment for dogs starts killing fleas within 1 hour with just a single dose. In the event of continued infestation, you can repeat treatment as often as once per day. These flavored soft chews are for dogs and puppies 10 weeks of age and older. You can treat immediately when you see fleas on your dog. Advantus soft chews were designed with flexibility in mind, so you can use one chew per day because the active ingredient quickly dissipates in your dog's system. If your dog has food allergies to ingredients like chicken or beef, Advantus is a suitable option because it does not contain any animal protein. The Advantus dog flea treatment starts working fast and can be used together with heartworm preventatives, dewormers, shampoos and antibiotics. Warning: Not for human use. Keep this product and all drugs out of the reach of children and pets."

Give your dog all the same teeth-cleaning action of DENTASTIX treats with a dual flavor punch!"

            "As creators of the FURminator deShedding Tool, FURminator continues to raise the bar with innovative, proprietary shedding solutions. The FURminator lineup of deShedding tools, grooming tools, hair care products, bathing and hygiene solutions broadens and enhances the FURminator deShedding experience for pet parents and their pets. Simply put, there is no pet care solution on the market like the FURminator product line. The FURminator deShedding Tool for Cats features a short hair stainless steel deShedding edge to reach through topcoat and safely remove loose hair and undercoat without damaging the coat or cutting the skin. The FURejector button releases hair with ease, making deShedding easier than ever! You will love the ergonomic handle for comfort and ease of use as you deShed your cat. Up to 2/3 of the hair a cat sheds is ingested during self-grooming, resulting in hairballs that are messy, stressful to the cat and cause potentially serious problems. You can help by reducing the excess hair that can be the culprit of these hairball problems.",

            "Pets will always shed, and as long as they live indoors, you, the pet parent will always need a way to reduce pet hair. As industry innovators and experts on pet hair, FURminator understands the entire shedding cycle and the role that hair care and hygiene play in helping to reduce shedding and make you and your pet happy. For that reason, FURminator developed a high-performance line of hair-care, nail, hygiene, and waterless products.",
            "By reducing shedding up to 90%, the FURminator deShedding tool enables you to share your home with your cat, without surrendering it to his hair. FURminator deShedding tools eliminate the frustration associated with shedding, and keeping their coat healthy and beautiful. In addition, they keep pets comfortable and safe, the line of deShedding tools eliminate every concern associated with shedding for all pets, and that\u2019s why both pets and pet parents love FURminator.",
            "Usage Instructions",
            "Please read all instructions and FAQs carefully before you begin. Use the FURminator deShedding Tool only as directed.",
            "1. For best results, we recommend deShedding your pet immediately after washing and drying. Use only on a completely dry coat. Our extensive line of FURminator deShedding products are designed to promote healthy skin and coat and reduce excess shedding.",
            "2. Before using the deShedding tool, perform a complete physical inspection of your pet. Remove tangles or mats with a FURminator Slicker Brush or Finishing Comb before using the deShedding tool. Look for sores, bruises and skin conditions, which may be concealed by his coat. If your pet has any of these conditions, seek treatment from a veterinarian before brushing.",
            "3. Use the deShedding tool much like a brush and gently stroke across the pet\u2019s coat in the direction of hair growth, angling the stainless steel teeth of the deShedding edge toward the coat. Start from the head and work your way back, using extra care near the pet\u2019s stomach, legs, genitals and anus. Avoid making excessive strokes in a single area, instead using long, gentle strokes up and away from your pet\u2019s skin. Deep or rough brushing can cause your pet\u2019s skin to become red and irritated, so do not apply too much weight or downward pressure. If you notice any redness or irritation, discontinue use.",

Simply select the tool that matches your cat's body size then select either the short hair or long hair edge for a truly customized grooming experience. Matching each cat to the ideal tool significantly enhances deShedding results.",
            "Frequently Asked Questions",
            "Can the deShedding tool be used on all pets?",
            "The deShedding tool may be used on most long- and short-haired pets, including dogs, cats, horses, rabbits, ferrets and other small pets. The edge is designed to make grooming pets faster and easier. The deShedding tool should not be used on non-shedding breeds or on pets with particularly sensitive skin.",
            "How often and how long should I use the FURminator deShedding Tool?",
            "We recommend using the FURminator deShedding tool 1-2 times a week for 10 to 20 minutes each session, though the actual time will vary depending on the breed of your pet and the condition of his coat. You may need to use the deShedding tool more frequently during heavy shedding seasons.",
            "Where should I perform the grooming process?",
            "The deShedding tool will remove a high volume of loose hair and undercoat, so for convenient cleanup, choose a location that is easy to vacuum or sweep, such as a tile floor indoors or outside. Or, use the FURminator vacuum accessory for easy clean up for use with the small, medium and large FURminator deShedding Tools. Always choose a location where your pet is comfortable and safe.",
            "How do I take care of my deShedding tool?",

Inspired by a dog\u2019s powerful sense of smell, we developed a long-lasting durable chew that\u2019s jam-packed with real bacon. Once your dog takes a bite of our USA-made chews, he\u2019ll be hooked.",

If you\u2019re unsure, check with your vet. Nobody likes an unexpected trip to the dentist. Keep an eye out for wear and tear. Within a month or so, we find that most dogs chew Benebone into submission. See the wear page on our website for helpful photos to determine when to replace yours.

            "The Secret to Contented Cats! The Feliway Refill plugs direct into your Diffuser (sold separately) can be left plugged in all the time, building up the pheromones in the room (up to 50-70m2), one vial lasting up to 4 weeks. Feliway mimics the natural pheromone that a Cat leaves as scent marks when they rub their faces against furniture and doorways to show they are somewhere they feel is safe and reassuring. Like the natural pheromone, Feliway encourages the Cat to come back home to rest and recuperate.Feliway can be used to reduce stress and its consequences, such as loss of appetite, reduced playfulness and lack of interaction. Feliway is also clinically proven to help problem behaviour in Cats such as indoor urine marking, destructive scratching and fear of travel. These signs of stress are often: when a new Cat, or another pet is introduced to the home when Cats with different personalities have to share the same home when Cats go somewhere stressful, like the Cattery or vets when Cats experience change, such as moving house or when owners are away on holiday when travelling by car, boat or plane when the home is more busy or noisy than the Cat cam cope with e.g. Christmas, during family visits etc"

            "We believe dogs deserve food that is just as good (dare we say better?) as our own. This commitment drives our choices, from how we raise our animals, to the ingredients we choose, to the kitchens we use. You\u2019ll notice the difference the second you open a bag of our natural dog treats. Our Full Moon treats are made with love in the USA. We work exclusively with the trusted family farmers and ranchers we\u2019ve been in business with for years, ensuring that animals are raised to the highest ethical standards. Every bite begins with USDA-approved, human-grade meat\u2014 cooked in gleaming kitchens using only 100% natural ingredients\u2014and ends with a satisfied pup. Each of our healthy snacks, like Full Moon Beef Jerky, are free of artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors and full of things dogs love. Glycerin and fillers like corn, wheat, and soy have no place in our recipes. In other words, we only use simple, natural ingredients you\u2019d find in a grocery store and likely eat yourself, like real beef, celery, and organic cane sugar. Unlike most pet food, we slow cook our treats in small batches using time honored techniques like smoking and roasting to retain more of the food\u2019s nutritional value and flavor. It results in a far better product that we think your pup will appreciate. And if you\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll share! Check out our full line of Full Moon Pet treats and training dog treats, including Wild and Organic Jerky today!"

            "Strike scooping the litter box off your to-do list. With the ScoopFree Complete Plus Top-Entry Self-Cleaning Litter Box, theres no scooping, cleaning or refilling your cats litter box for weeks. It uses crystal litter that provides 5 times better odor control than traditional clumping litter by absorbing urine and dehydrating solid waste. This low-tracking litter also helps keep your floors clean because it is 99% dust free and doesnt stick to your cats paws. Safety sensors ensure that the scooping cycle only occurs when your cat is out of the box. It uses disposable trays that have a plastic lining to help protect against leaking, and each tray comes with a lid for quick and easy disposal. Just remove the tray and throw it away. Theres even a health counter that tracks how many times your furry feline uses the box, which is a convenient way to detect early signs of a health issue. The included top-entry privacy cover gives your cat a secluded bathroom. Your pet deserves the best. Trust PetSafe to help keep your pet healthy, safe and happy."

The active ingredients in our 16 oz. bottle of Flea and Tick Dog and Cat Shampoo are proven to kill and control fleas and ticks on contact and provide relief from symptoms including droppings/flea dirt in dog\u2019s coat, allergic dermatitis, excessive scratching, licking or biting at skin, hair loss, tapeworms and pale gums. Follow directions on bottle for best results. This Flea and Tick Shampoo is paraben and soap- free. It contains no harsh soaps or damaging detergents, only the gentlest naturally derived cleansers that are pH balanced for your pet\u2019s skin. For best results, follow instructions on product packaging carefully. Wear rubber gloves when applying Flea and Tick Shampoo for dogs and cats. When shampooing your dog, avoid eyes. Use a cloth or sponge to shampoo around your dog\u2019s eyes. Thoroughly wet the entire coat with warm water and then apply enough shampoo to make a lather and work thoroughly into the coat. For maximum parasite control allow lather to remain in contact with skin for \ufb01ve to ten minutes before rinsing. Do not reapply product for 7 days. Flea and Tick shampoo is safe for dogs, cats, ferrets and horses 12 weeks and older. We know that your dogs and cats are more than just pets - they are part of the family - so Veterinary Formula Clinical Care designs premium medicated products that pet parents can actually afford. Your pet will be free of fleas and ticks, smell great and have a soft, shiny and lustrous coat and you will be relieved to have a home treatment that really works \u2013 making you both happy and able to focus on more important things like treats, games and snuggles."

Made from the same super-sturdy, puncture-resistant, non-toxic rubber as the black Extreme Kong, it's the perfect toy for the home-alone canine. Recommended by vets and trainers for dogs with problem behaviors or separation anxiety, the Extreme Goodie Bone helps satisfy dogs' natural urges to hunt, chase, and gnaw, keeping them happy and busy for hours while their owner's away. The innovative design features holes with patented Goodie Grippers on each end. Stuff the holes with biscuits, dry foods, or Kong brand Stuff 'n pastes or treats, and watch your dog go to work extracting the contents; the grippers make the \"hunt\" harder, and therefore more fun.

Regularly inspect your goodie bone for cracks or missing chunks, and replace worn or damaged toys to avoid a choking hazard.

            "Training pads are ideal for puppies and dogs that stay indoors for long periods of time. What you should do; unfold the training pad and place it in a confined area. (Blue plastic side down). it is important to place your puppy or dog on the training pad several times a day in order to get him used it. On the average, a puppy must relieve himself every few hours, based on his age (A 2 month old puppy every 2 hours, a 3 month old Every hours etc. ). If your pet relieves himself somewhere other than the designated spot where the pad is placed, bring him back to the correct spot immediately. Keep in mind that your pet will have to relive himself shortly after a meal and will need to eliminate more frequently during the summer when his water intake is higher. The minute your dog begins to relieve himself on the pad, be sure to use cures like \"go putty\". You should use this cue every time that your dog relives himself on the pad so that he associates The phrase with the action of elimination. Every time that your pet used the pad successfully, make sure that you give him a treat and lots of praise. Treating helps your dog to understand that he is doing what you Want him to do. Always remember to dispose of soiled pads and replace them as needed. When your pet begins to relieve himself on the pads, on consistent basic, it is time to begin moving the pad closer to the door. Keep moving the pads closer to the door until they are actually outside. At this time, the training process will be complete."

            "The Arm & Hammer Heavy Duty Pet Waste Bags are a must-have for pet owners who want to keep their surroundings clean and odor-free. Simply pull a single bag from the perforated section, loop the handles around the molded hooks on the side of the bin, tie the easy-tie handles, and dispose.The Arm & Hammer Heavy Duty Pet Waste Bags were originally designed to work seamlessly with the Arm & Hammer Swivel Bin and Rake pooper scooper, with their E-Z Dispense design making disposal quick and easy during yard clean-ups. However, these bags are versatile enough to also fit in standard poop bag dispensers, making them an ideal option for pet owners on walks or outdoor adventures. Another noteworthy feature of these bags is their heavy-duty construction. They are two times thicker than standard grocery bags, ensuring that they can handle even the messiest of pet waste. Additionally, the large capacity of the bags makes them ideal for picking up waste from the entire yard, without having to constantly change bags. This feature also helps to keep your dog pooper scooper clean, saving you the hassle of having to clean it frequently. Odor control is another crucial factor to consider when dealing with pet waste, and the Arm & Hammer Heavy Duty Pet Waste Bags have got you covered. They come with a fresh scent that helps to neutralize foul odors, ensuring that your surroundings remain pleasant and fresh. The inclusion of activated baking soda further enhances the odor control capability of these bags, making them a highly effective solution for pet waste disposal. In addition to being great for use with pets, they can also be used for diaper disposal, making them a valuable addition to your home and pet supplies."

            "This collar is made of strong textile material, pleasant to the touch. In appearance it harmonizes with the color & Gray rubber leashes, but it does not stick to the Fur of the dog, as the Thin rubber threads are replaced with polyester in the collar and the harness. The CLOSABLE HANDLE located at the central ring allows the dog to be held firmly and lifted securely. Firm fixing is ensured by a heavy duty buckle and a safety strap fastener. The strap Material of the collar is easy to clean and dimensiolly stable. A hook and loop surface allows the attachment of various labels - from now on, besides on the harness, your dog can also wear cool patches on its collar as well. The small patches fit the color & Gray collars with handle. Color & gray's color scheme and designs are protected by industrial design rights.

            "Strike scooping the litter box off your to do list. With the ScoopFree Ultra Self-Cleaning Litter Box, there\u2019s no scooping, cleaning or refilling your cat\u2019s litter box for weeks. It uses the crystal litter that provides 5 times better odor control than traditional clumping litter by absorbing the urine and dehydrating solid waste. This low tracking litter also helps keep your floors clean because it is 99 percent dust free and doesn\u2019t stick to your cat\u2019s paws. Safety sensors ensure that the scooping cycle only occurs when your cat is out of the box. It uses disposable trays that have a plastic lining to help protect against leaking, and each tray comes with a lid for quick and easy disposal. There\u2019s even a health counter that tracks how many times your furry feline uses the box, which is a convenient way to detect early signs of a health issue, and the included privacy cover gives your cat a secluded bathroom. PetSafe brand is here to help you and your pet live happy together.",

            "Dogs are good at pulling, and if youre training a sled dog team, then youre grateful for that natural ability. But since most dog parents usually go on normal walks instead of mushing, we designed the Deluxe Easy Walk Harness to counteract your dogs desire to pull. With this harness, the leash attaches at the front of your dogs chest, unlike standard collars or back-attachment harnesses which compel the pet parent to pull from behind. This means when your dog pulls forward while wearing the Easy Walk Harness, he will feel your weight from one side and will be less tempted to pull. This deluxe version differs from our standard Easy Walk Harness with added neoprene straps for cool comfort and reflector strips for night safety. This harness was created by a veterinary behaviorist and is trusted by a million dog parents and trainers each year. If you accidentally purchase the wrong size, or if your dog mistakes his harness for a chew toy, our Customer Care experts are happy to assist with replacements or resizing. Your pet deserves the best. Trust PetSafe to help keep your pet healthy, safe and happy."

Use this replacement can with your existing SSSCAT Spray Deterrent (PPD00-16168). When your pet is within 3 feet of the spray deterrent, the motion-activated sensor detects your pets movements and releases a quick burst of spray. The spray startles your pet and discourages them from staying in the off-limits area. This odorless spray is safe, harmless and does not stain surfaces. Each SSSCAT spray can contains approximately 80-100 bursts of spray. Trust PetSafe to help keep your pet healthy, safe and happy."

Want to extend the chew session? Stuff with KONG Snacks\u2122 and entice with a bit of KONG Easy Treat\u2122.",

            "Made from the same super-durable, puncture-resistant, non-toxic rubber as classic Kong toys, this versatile, bone-shaped chew is just the thing for the home-alone dog. Dogs were made to hunt, chase, and gnaw, and denied a way to satisfy these natural urges, they can turn into barkers, diggers, shoe-chewers, or worse. Recommended by vets and trainers for dogs with problem behaviors or separation anxiety, the Goodie Bone can keep dogs happy and busy for hours while their owner's away. The innovative design features holes with patented Goodie Grippers on each end. Stuff the holes with biscuits, dry foods, or Kong brand Stuff 'n pastes or treats, and watch your dog go to work extracting the contents; the grippers make the \"hunt\" harder, and therefore more fun. Measuring seven inches long, the red goodie bone is appropriate for most medium- to large-sized breeds with normal chewing habits; switch to a super-durable black Extreme goodie bone for aggressive chewers. Regularly inspect your goodie bone for cracks or missing chunks, and replace worn or damaged toys to avoid a choking hazard. Satisfaction is guaranteed; if either you or your dog aren't happy with your purchase, return within 30 days for a full refund.",
