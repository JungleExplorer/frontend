Articles and departments entertain and inspire readers to learn about their world with amazing information about animals, science, technology, archaeology, geography, and pop culture, plus jokes, games, activities in every issue.",
            "Amazon.com Review",
            "National Geographic Kids magazine is aimed at young readers from six years and up who want to find out more about the world around them. The magazine contains a superb blend of photos, fun facts, and articles presented in a cheery style, making it perfect for keeping kids' attention. National Geographic Kids magazine has been presenting information to kids in an accessible way for over thirty-five years.  You can expect the same kind of subjects to be included in National Geographic Kids magazine that you get in the adult version-animals, science, archaeology, and geography-but with technology and pop culture added to the mix too. As you might expect, there is also a strong emphasis on magnificent wildlife photography. Frequent appearances of animal posters can be found within the pages, as well as high-quality photographs sprinkled throughout the magazine. The addition of games and jokes, alongside other activities such as puzzles and competitions, keeps the subjects light, while still getting across the important facts.  Your children can explore ancient civilizations on one page, come face-to-face with exotic wildlife on another, and turn the next page to a make and do project, which is often perfect for homework. There are always plenty of gross/interesting facts about animals that your children are certain to share with you, or they can turn to the page that gives them the low-down on their favorite star. Regular competitions are sure to keep your kids involved too.  This quality publication ensures that your children learn while still having fun, so they are more likely to retain the information. National Geographic Kids magazine really helps to bring the world to life, and gets your children excited about learning."

A signature mix of politics, world affairs, business, science, arts and letters attracts millions who come to The New Yorker to be informed, to be surprised, to laugh, and to be moved. Recent issues have included Hendrik Hertzberg on the Clinton and Obama showdown; Margaret Talbot on talking animals; James Surowiecki on the Bear Stearn's collapse; David Sedaris on smoking; and fiction by Annie Proulx. Past Issues:  Contributors: Among The New Yorker staff writers, Ken Auletta, who covers the media business and is an authority on the communications industry, is the author of 9 books, including the best-seller Three Blind Mice: How the TV Networks Lost Their Way. Seymour M. Hersh has written for The New Yorker since 1971. He has won numerous awards including the Pulitzer Prize for his investigations into the My Lai massacre, and is the author of eight books, including Chain of Command. The legendary John McPhee, on staff since 1965, teaches writing at Princeton. Jerome Groopman is a Harvard Medical School professor and the author of over 150 scientific articles. His latest book, The Anatomy of Hope, was a best-seller.  Magazine Layout: The New Yorker is a readers' magazine. Articles range from short Talk of the Town pieces to in-depth explorations of politics and world affairs. Short reviews of restaurants, movies and the arts in Goings On About Town can be quickly skimmed, while, at the back of the book, longer, richer reviews of selected books, plays and movies can be read at a more leisurely pace. And the dozen or so cartoons in each issue offer their sheer wit and entertainment.  Comparisons to Other Magazines:  The New Yorker offers the long-form journalism that has all but disappeared in today's media landscape. New Yorker writers are not bound by daily deadlines, and it is not uncommon for them to spend months working on an article. Nor are the writers constrained by a mandated point of view. They are free to follow a story wherever it leads.  Advertising:  Advertisers include financial service companies, car-makers, luxury goods purveyors, hotels, publishers, and arts events. Small ads throughout the magazine offer a boutique-style shopping experience for everything from customized jewelry and Panama hats, to expedition ship cruises and villa rentals.  Awards:  The New Yorker is the most-honored magazine in publishing history. It has won 48 National Magazine Awards, the magazine world's equivalent of the Oscars. Its contributors have won many of the major awards, including The Nobel prize and The Pulitzer prize. In 2008, two of the Pulitzer-Prize winning books included work that originally appeared in The New Yorker: The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz won the fiction prize and Time and Materials by Robert Hass won for poetry.  Amazon.com Review:  Founded in 1925, The New Yorker hardly changed for its first 60 years, both in its dry, type-heavy design and in its reputation as a writer's and reader's haven. In 1987 it was on only its second editor when management decided to shake things up. A rocky decade ensued, but The New Yorker is now back at the top of its game under David Remnick's editorship. Each issue offers commentaries and reporting on politics, culture, and events, with a focus that's both national and international; humor and cartoons; fiction and poetry; and reviews of books, movies, theater, music, art, and fashion. Several times a year special issues focus on a theme--music, fashion, business. The writing is mostly first-rate, frequently coming from top literary and journalistic talents. The New Yorker's weekly issues can seem overwhelming--so much good stuff to read, piling up so fast!--but it's as easy to dip in for a small snack as it is to wade in for a substantial meal. --Nicholas H.

            "The world of food is huge, and Food & Wine magazine covers it thoroughly. From tasty gourmet recipes you can make at home to the best food lover's destinations, from handy tools that belong in every kitchen to a rundown of the world's most exciting new liquors and wines, Food & Wine Magazine brings you exciting and useful articles and features. Each issue includes several long features and regular columns written by some of the best chefs and food experts in the industry.  Food & Wine magazine was founded on the principle that delights in the best food and drink should not be reserved for the self-appointed epicureans and experts, but should rather be accessible to everyone. Recipes are designed to be just as manageable for a chef hobbyist as an experienced restaurateur. Food meccas covered within its pages include ordinary places like Water Valley, Mississippi, as well as more exotic locales like New Orleans or Naples, Italy.  Regular columns in Food & Wine Magazine include suggestions for selecting the best foods and beverages, kitchen basics tutorials, wine guides, fast recipes, entertaining tips, and new foods to try. The online magazine portal enhances the print magazine with video tutorials and slideshows, and the blog has clever tips and ideas for enhancing your food and entertaining lifestyle. Even the magazine's advertisements add to the content, keeping you informed of new foodie developments and providing fresh recipes and ideas the magazine has not yet covered.  For a magazine you'll want to save and savor, a subscription to Food & Wine Magazine provides the perfect pairing.",

            "Feature Articles: Feature articles in each issue cover a broad range of topics guaranteed to be of interest to our readers. Reports on new culinary trends, new restaurants, travel destinations with important and exciting culinary experiences, profiles of major chefs, advice about wine and wine pairings, and of course, amazing recipes -- all tested and perfected in the Food & Wine test kitchen. Special Issues Included in Your Subscription:  Each July, the Food & Wine Best New Chefs are announced -- naming ten up-and-coming rising stars in the culinary world. Past Best New Chefs include notables such as Daniel Boulud, Tom Colicchio, Todd English and Thomas Keller. The October issue focuses on wine, revealing the winners of Food & Wine's American Wine Awards.   Magazine Layout:  The pages of Food & Wine are designed in a contemporary style. Recipes are easy to read and the instructions have been tested so they are complete and easy to follow. Feature stories are accompanied by beautiful, mouth-watering photographs.   Contributors: Contributors are chosen for their knowledge of and passion for the culinary lifestyle, including luminaries in the restaurant world, such as Jacques Pepin and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, to cookbook authors, expert wine-makers and food artisans.  Past Issues:  Comparisons to Other Magazines:  Food & Wine is not just a compilation of recipes, but rather covers the entire range of topics of interest for our sophisticated readers: profiles of chefs (from the luminaries of the restaurant world to the up-and-coming chefs who are the superstars of tomorrow), travel destinations explored through their tastes and flavors, and expert advice about the best buys in wine (from the most worthwhile splurges to great bargains) and wine pairings.  Advertisers:  Most of the advertising in Food & Wine is specific to the culinary interests of its readers: including food products and ingredients, kitchen equipment, wine merchants, and destination travel advertisements.  Awards:  The James Beard Foundation has honored Food & Wine many times over the years, for journalism about the restaurant industry, emerging food trends, and wine coverage. Food & Wine also was the Gold Winner of the 2008 Folio Eddie Award, for the September 2007 anniversary issue. The Food & Wine Classic in Aspen is America's premier culinary event. Hailed by the New York Times as \"the granddaddy of them all\", the event features three incomparable days of cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, seminars and panel discussions by world-class talent, such as Jacques Pepin, Bobby Flay, Emeril Lagasse, Mario Batali, and Danny Meyer. Food & Wine is also proud to be a sponsor of Bravo's Top Chef. Amazon.com Review  Focusing on a central theme in each issue, such as 25 party ideas (number 25: nautical party) or 35 quick and tasty dishes, Food & Wine indulges a broad range of culinary connoisseurs and thirsty enophiles. Expect a number of well-rounded recipes and festive commentary on the theme at hand, but don't expect that Food & Wine will be weighed down by said theme--each issue also contains a home shopping guide (in case you need to know where to purchase a green bamboo tray), restaurant reviews, a Drinks/Wine section, and shorter articles that run from \"Win a Date with a Chef\" to \"The Joy of Slow Cooking.\" --A.J.

            "Amazon.com Review",
            "American Girl magazine is an appropriate, entertaining, and informative magazine for girls over eight years old. A great alternative to more traditional teen magazines, each issue of American Girl magazine includes craft ideas, puzzles, contests, advice, games, and other fun activities and articles.  If you have daughters or granddaughters, American Girl magazine is a great preteen magazine that they can turn to for fun party ideas like back-to-school sleepovers or crafting ideas they can use to decorate their rooms in unique and colorful ways. Many parents like the fact that the magazine doesn't put too much focus on boys, makeup, and other more subjects to which girls are often overexposed.  In addition to all of the fun information packed into each issue of American Girl magazine, the magazine also contains useful articles that can help girls deal with everyday problems they may face, such as how to handle relationship issues with friends. Each issue celebrates girls' creativity, self-expression, and independence and fosters a sense of confidence in its readers.  The magazine is a great gift idea for any girl over the age of eight, but especially those in their preteen years who are looking for ways to boost their self-confidence and become smart, strong young women. American Girl magazine stresses the importance of learning and education and doesn't focus on more frivolous subjects that girls often preoccupy themselves with. It encourages girls to be good citizens in their communities and good role models for those around them."

Regular features covering new hotels around the globe, road trip ideas, and cruise ship ports of call help you keep your finger on the pulse of the latest travel trends.  The writing style of National Geographic Traveler magazine is personal and heartfelt, so you experience the writer's impressions of the area as though you were there and get a true sense of the place. While some of the articles cover once-in-a-lifetime trips, such as scaling a mountain or trekking across a desert, others dip into little-known adventures closer to home, such as national parks and historic sites across the United States.

            "The world of food is huge, and Food & Wine magazine covers it thoroughly. From tasty gourmet recipes you can make at home to the best food lover's destinations, from handy tools that belong in every kitchen to a rundown of the world's most exciting new liquors and wines, Food & Wine Magazine brings you exciting and useful articles and features. Each issue includes several long features and regular columns written by some of the best chefs and food experts in the industry.  Food & Wine magazine was founded on the principle that delights in the best food and drink should not be reserved for the self-appointed epicureans and experts, but should rather be accessible to everyone. Recipes are designed to be just as manageable for a chef hobbyist as an experienced restaurateur. Food meccas covered within its pages include ordinary places like Water Valley, Mississippi, as well as more exotic locales like New Orleans or Naples, Italy.  Regular columns in Food & Wine Magazine include suggestions for selecting the best foods and beverages, kitchen basics tutorials, wine guides, fast recipes, entertaining tips, and new foods to try. The online magazine portal enhances the print magazine with video tutorials and slideshows, and the blog has clever tips and ideas for enhancing your food and entertaining lifestyle. Even the magazine's advertisements add to the content, keeping you informed of new foodie developments and providing fresh recipes and ideas the magazine has not yet covered.  For a magazine you'll want to save and savor, a subscription to Food & Wine Magazine provides the perfect pairing."

            "The Economist is the premier source for the analysis of world business and current affairs, providing authoritative insight and opinion on international news, world politics, business, finance, science and technology, as well as overviews of cultural trends and regular Special reports on industries and countries. Established in 1843 to campaign against the protectionist corn laws, The Economist remains, in the second half of its second century, true to the liberal principles of its founder. James Wilson, a hat maker from the small Scottish town of Hawick, believed in free trade, internationalism and minimum interference by government, especially in the affairs of the market. The Economist also takes a fiercely independent stance on social issues, from gay marriage to the legalisation of drugs, but its main service to its readers is as a global newspaper: To uncover new ideas from all around the world.",
            "Amazon.com Review",
            "Anyone wanting to stay up-to-date on the latest national and world news will find The Economist magazine invaluable. Each issue contains detailed articles to satisfy every interest, including topics such as current affairs, the latest political climate, business affairs, and economics. In addition, it frequently features articles in areas such as science or technology to provide those perspectives, and also includes country-specific information because the state of countries such as China directly impact the rest of the world.  For readers who are interested in the latest news on art, entertainment, political, and world news, The Economist magazine also regularly includes book and movie reviews. Having such a well-rounded depth of content is one of the reasons it is one of the most popular current affairs magazines in circulation today.  The Economist magazine is written in a concise manner to ensure that it provides the most detailed information available on each given subject in the limited amount of space provided. The magazine publishers know that their readers' time is valuable, and they want readers to be able to quickly get the information they need.  If you pride yourself on always being aware of the latest in world news, economics, and politics, and you want one resource in which you can easily access current information on these subjects and more, The Economist magazine can provide you with everything you need. Or, if you know someone in the business world who needs to stay on top of current affairs to ensure professional success, The Economist magazine also can be a very useful gift."

            "The color Kindle edition of The Economist - US Edition is now available on the Kindle Reading App for your Android device. Download issues at no extra cost from Archived Items. The Economist is the premier source for the analysis of world business and current affairs, providing authoritative insight and opinion on international news, world politics, business, finance, science and technology, as well as overviews of cultural trends and regular Special reports on industries and countries. Established in 1843 to campaign against the protectionist corn laws, The Economist remains, in the second half of its second century, true to the liberal principles of its founder. James Wilson, a hat maker from the small Scottish town of Hawick, believed in free trade, internationalism and minimum interference by government, especially in the affairs of the market. The Economist also takes a fiercely independent stance on social issues, from gay marriage to the legalisation of drugs, but its main service to its readers is as a global newspaper: To uncover new ideas from all around the world. The Kindle Edition of The Economist contains all of the articles and graphics found in the print edition, but will not include all photos. For your convenience, issues are auto-delivered wirelessly to your Kindle each Friday at the same time the print edition hits the newsstand."

            "Motorcycle Consumer News magazine is one of the top magazines for motorcycle lovers. Unlike other publications that use articles from any writer, this magazine only publishes pieces written by motorcycle enthusiasts, and the experience of those writers oozes off every page. Whether it's tips for riding around town or information on top destinations for motorcycle riders, every issue focuses on bikers.  Safety is an important component of riding, and each issue of Motorcycle Consumer News magazine focuses on staying safe. Proficient Motorcycling gives you tips on how to improve your performance, while Mental Motorcycling deals with ways to change your thought process while on your bike. The magazine even has a Medical Motorcycling section that discusses medical issues that can arise as the result of long-term riding, and what you can do to prevent those conditions.  Motorcycle Consumers News magazine lists the newest recall notices from manufacturers in its MC Bulletins section, which also highlights the hottest news stories in the industry. You will even find a Cycle Attorney section that answers questions from readers on safety and legal issues on the road, and some readers will page through to the What's Happening section to get information on riding tours and other motorcycling events. You can also read uplifting feature stories from riders and find reviews from experts on the latest motorcycle equipment, gear, and tools.  A subscription to Motorcycle Consumer News magazine helps you stay safe, discover answers to your motorcyling questions, and get information on recalls."

Past Issues:  Contributors: Discover draws on the talents of some of America's premier nonfiction writers, including Walter Isaacson, Jared Diamond, Jim Holt, and Carl Zimmer. Some of our contributors are veteran science journalists; others regard science just as one source of great ideas. What they all have in common is a rare ability to conduct deep investigations into the most complex topics and emerge with stories that will entertain and enlighten anyone who appreciates a good narrative.  Magazine Layout:  Discover gives its readers the real story: on-the-scene photography, highly personal portrait shots, and cutting edge scientific imagery. The design is elegant and refined--not dry like a textbook, not glossy and remote like a travel guide. Every issue contains a balance of big-idea, text driven stories and more image-rich features that convey the feel of where and how the most amazing research happens.  Comparisons to Other Magazines:  Discover examines what really matters about science and places it squarely in a human context. It is an accessible guide to the ideas that matter most in today's world. Unlike Scientific American, it is accessible to any curious reader, not just to science insiders. Unlike Popular Science and Popular Mechanics, it focuses on ideas and discoveries, not gadgets and weapons. And unlike National Geographic, it does not shy away from the personal, political, and social aspects of science. Above all, Discover is unique in combining deep, probing reporting with accessible, narrative writing--more in the mode of The New Yorker than in the style of traditional science journalism.  Advertising:  US Navy, Chevy, Hartford, Bose, Aridian Publishing, Shell, BBC, PBS, VISA, Ford, Ambien, GM, Sony, Sanyo, Discovery Channel, Math Tutor, Rosetta Stone, Gel Pro, Caravan Tours, First Street, Vanguard, Michelin, Lantus, etc.  Awards:  Discover was presented with an award by the American Society of Journalists and Authors for July '07 feature on Science and Islam.

Designed for the general reader, Discover translates and interprets many of the same stories professionals peruse in Scientific American. Accessible articles on genetically engineered food, what's living in your pillows, real robots in action, and what makes a Stradivarius sing add up to a truly delightful family science magazine. Each issue brings to light new and newsworthy topics to stimulate dinnertime and water-cooler conversations beyond the mundane, and Discover spices the mix with puzzles, Web links, book reviews, and experiments for amateur scientists. --Therese Littleton",

            "Amazon.com Review",
            "Penthouse magazine has entertained and delighted men since 1965 with its pictures of beautiful, scantily-clad (if at all) women and hot sex articles. In the 1990s, it went through a change to a harder-core format, but since 2005 has come back to its roots of soft-core pornography and erotica.  Columns in Penthouse magazine feature lots of sexually-explicit content and pictures of women designed to delight men. The famous Penthouse Forum, which publishes explicit letters from readers, is still a monthly feature. Several explicit pictorials run every month, some focusing on a specific model and others featuring several models around a theme like women with all-natural bodies or women from the military. A centerfold and accompanying pictorial features that month's Penthouse Pet. Other articles include interviews with Penthouse Pets, longer articles about sex-themed topics like sex museums and the BDSM world, and sexual adventure stories.  Penthouse magazine is not all about sex, though. Men will also find technology and fashion well-covered throughout each month's issue. Buying guides help you find the best electronics, toys, and man-themed gifts. Full Frontal, a monthly featured column, covers entertainment including gaming, movies, and DVDs. Other male indulgences like great scotch or premium cigars are frequent topics of discussion, as are hunting, fast cars, and sports.  Ultimately, Penthouse magazine is designed for men who aren't afraid to be men. Now that the magazine has come back to the great soft-core sex content that has always been its strength, it's time to take another look."
