            "Looking for a fun, free, and simple educational app to help your toddler learn phonics and trace letters of the alphabet? Look no further than ABC Kids.ABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!ABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.Best of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.Features:- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!Note to Parents:When creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

            "ClassDojo offers a beautiful classroom management platform for teachers to easily encourage any behavior or skill in the classroom and keep parents in the loop.Unlike most classroom management tools and behavior trackers like gold-star charts, ClassDojo helps teachers focus on positive feedback. Teachers can customize the behaviors or skills, such as \u201cWorking hard\u201d and \u201cParticipating\u201d, and instantly award students in class Dojo points for doing the right thing.Teachers can also put different sets of students into groups, offering a simple way for teachers to award table points and foster a collaborative classroom culture.Best of all, teachers can engage parents and provide them with a way to stay connected to the classroom and know how their child is doing. Parents can see their child\u2019s feedback from school in real-time, and view any comments made by teachers. Teachers can broadcast a message to all parents (such as sharing a reminder, assignment, homework, or permission slip), and also send private, meaningful communications like text messages and photos so that parents are connected to the classroom without the hassle of emails and school newsletters.Students can create their own accounts, customize their Dojo avatars, and self-reflect on their performance while in school or at home.Unlike most classroom management organizers and class planners, ClassDojo can be used on any device: laptops, tablets and phones, as well as smartboards - and it syncs seamlessly across all of them in real-time! The ClassDojo Support Team is top-notch, and available around the clock if you ever need help, too!"

            "Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\"For all the simplicity of the game\u2019s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy\u2018s is frightening. It\u2019s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It\u2019s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com"

            "A Note from the Developer: Hi, and thanks for taking a look at Virtual Families 2! We have been working on bringing this game over to Android for quite a while, and we are very happy to be able to finally share it with everyone.Before you skip down to bullet points and screenshots, let me say a few words about this game, and life simulations in general: I love life simulation games. I have always been passionate about designing them, and almost everything that comes out of Last Day of Work is a life sim of some kind. This one, in particular, thrills me so much because it is designed to have a life of its own: unpredictable and so different each time I play it, and each time another player plays it. I love that the story unfolds differently for everyone who plays it, and your experience with the game might be wildly different from your friends' experience.Designing this type of game, however, has its own challenges. The main challenge is that EVERYTHING in life is a great idea to add to a game like this. There are SO many great ideas, and we simply cannot put them all in at the beginning. So, while I hope the game captivates you as much as it does us, there will inevitably be things that you feel are missing and you would love to see added (tell us!).Enjoy Virtual Families 2! Please visit our Facebook page to give your own amazing ideas and suggestions, and don't forget to check in on your little family or they will get very sad. :)With sincere gratitude,Arthur HumphreyLead Designer, Last Day of Work"

            "A Note from the Developer: Hi, and thanks for taking a look at Virtual Families 2! We have been working on bringing this game over to Android for quite a while, and we are very happy to be able to finally share it with everyone.Before you skip down to bullet points and screenshots, let me say a few words about this game, and life simulations in general: I love life simulation games. I have always been passionate about designing them, and almost everything that comes out of Last Day of Work is a life sim of some kind. This one, in particular, thrills me so much because it is designed to have a life of its own: unpredictable and so different each time I play it, and each time another player plays it. I love that the story unfolds differently for everyone who plays it, and your experience with the game might be wildly different from your friends' experience.Designing this type of game, however, has its own challenges. The main challenge is that EVERYTHING in life is a great idea to add to a game like this. There are SO many great ideas, and we simply cannot put them all in at the beginning. So, while I hope the game captivates you as much as it does us, there will inevitably be things that you feel are missing and you would love to see added (tell us!).Enjoy Virtual Families 2! Please visit our Facebook page to give your own amazing ideas and suggestions, and don't forget to check in on your little family or they will get very sad. :)With sincere gratitude,Arthur HumphreyLead Designer, Last Day of Work"

The most important period of education in a persons life, as it is when you are taught the most basic but essential lessons like your ABCs, 123s, shapes and colors that add meaning to your life. It is also important because kindergarten is where children are able to learn and recollect the maximum, hence a lot of attention should be paid to the education that kids receive during this time. We at Preschool Nursery Rhymes do exactly that; we create compilations of videos for kids that pays sole attention to making the child learn the most in the least amount of time. Our educational videos are filled with lyrics from your toddler\u2019s favorite nursery rhymes and our original songs for kids, accompanied by music that will store itself indefinitely in your child\u2019s little brain. Parents, allow us to be the teachers at home as we bring along a number of special cartoon characters to help us create the perfect homeschool environment for your babies!"

Pearl\u2019s Peril is a stunningly beautiful hidden object game that sweeps you away to an age of intrigue and romance, where polite appearances give way to inner greed and familial bonds are broken by betrayal. Make friends, fall in love, and seek clues in hundreds of hidden object scenes.  But heed one piece of advice; trust nobody.  Pearl Wallace lives the exciting life of an heiress and socialite in 1920\u2019s New York City. That is, until her father\u2019s sudden suicide plunges her into a world of intrigue and mystery.

            "Witches are trying to conquer Hazewich, and threatening secrets from the past keep surfacing! If that weren\u2019t enough, demons walk right by you, and scary symbols keep appearing in the morgue following enigmatic murders. Are you ready to confront the overwhelming evil to save your old town \u2026 and maybe the whole world? Seven years have passed since your parents Audrey and Patrick went missing and you left Hazewich. When your granddad asks you to come back urgently, it\u2019s clear that strange things are happening again. No one meets you at the station upon arrival, the town and its people are gloomily silent, electricity goes out for no reason and windows are framed with strange datura plants. Worse, there is no return date on your ticket! Are you doomed to stay here forever? Is this world even real? And could this all be related to the mysterious Mirror of Avatifa that broke many years ago? Meet lovely Amanda living next door and fight the devilry together. Wander the desolate streets and rid Hazewich of the spooky forces that are trying to destroy your world!

            "As a follow-up to Endless Alphabet, set the stage for early reading success with Endless Reader! This app introduces \"sight words\", the most commonly used words in school, library, and children's books. Kids need to recognize these words by sight in order to achieve reading fluency. Recognizing sight words is advantageous for beginning readers because many of these words have unusual spelling, cannot be sounded out using phonics knowledge, and often cannot be represented using pictures. Kids will have a blast learning sight words and their context and usage with the adorable Endless monsters. Each word features an interactive word puzzle with letters that come alive, and then a sentence puzzle with words that become what they describe. See the word \"dog\" as a barking dog, and the word \"up\" reach for the sky! ** NOTE: You must be online and have sufficient disk space while running the app to get all words you purchase in the app. **"

If you have a newer phone then this shouldn't be a problem!Welcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!What could go wrong?As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment."

It will teach your toddler sorting and logical skills along with early mathematics, giving them the perfect foundation for a lifetime of learning.Note to Parents:When creating Math Kids, we focused on building the best possible learning experience for children of all ages. We're parents ourselves, so we know exactly what makes a good educational game, as well as what doesn't. We released Kids Math as a completely free game with no in-app purchases or third party ads. Math Kids is full featured, frustration free, and ready to go. It\u2019s exactly the kind of educational app we want for our children, and we think your family will enjoy it, too!- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"
