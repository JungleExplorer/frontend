            "is a rare gem of a novel--beautifully written and populated by characters who linger in your memory and heart. August Pullman is a 10-year-old boy who likes Star Wars and Xbox, ordinary except for his jarring facial anomalies. Homeschooled all his life, August heads to public school for fifth grade and he is not the only one changed by the experience--something we learn about first-hand through the narratives of those who orbit his world. August\u2019s internal dialogue and interactions with students and family ring true, and though remarkably courageous he comes across as a sweet, funny boy who wants the same things others want: friendship, understanding, and the freedom to be himself. \u201cIt is only with one\u2019s heart that one can see clearly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.\u201d From",

            "OrdinaryI know I\u2019m not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. I mean, sure, I do ordinary things. I eat ice cream. I ride my bike. I play ball. I have an XBox. Stuff like that makes me ordinary. I guess. And I feel ordinary. Inside. But I know ordinary kids don\u2019t make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids don\u2019t get stared at wherever they go.If I found a magic lamp and I could have one wish, I would wish that I had a normal face that no one ever noticed at all. I would wish that I could walk down the street without people seeing me and then doing that look-away thing. Here\u2019s what I think: the only reason I\u2019m not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way.But I\u2019m kind of used to how I look by now. I know how to pretend I don\u2019t see the faces people make. We\u2019ve all gotten pretty good at that sort of thing: me, Mom and Dad, Via. Actually, I take that back: Via\u2019s not so good at it. She can get really annoyed when people do something rude. Like, for instance, one time in the playground some older kids made some noises. I don\u2019t even know what the noises were exactly because I didn\u2019t hear them myself, but Via heard and she just started yelling at the kids. That\u2019s the way she is. I\u2019m not that way.Via doesn\u2019t see me as ordinary. She says she does, but if I were ordinary, she wouldn\u2019t feel like she needs to protect me as much. And Mom and Dad don\u2019t see me as ordinary, either. They see me as extraordinary. I think the only person in the world who realizes how ordinary I am is me.My name is August, by the way. I won\u2019t describe what I look like. Whatever you\u2019re thinking, it\u2019s probably worse.Why I Didn\u2019t Go to SchoolNext week I start fifth grade. Since I\u2019ve never been to a real school before, I am pretty much totally and completely petrified. People think I haven\u2019t gone to school because of the way I look, but it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s because of all the surgeries I\u2019ve had. Twenty-seven since I was born. The bigger ones happened before I was even four years old, so I don\u2019t remember those. But I\u2019ve had two or three surgeries every year since then (some big, some small), and because I\u2019m little for my age, and I have some other medical mysteries that doctors never really figured out, I used to get sick a lot. That\u2019s why my parents decided it was better if I didn\u2019t go to school. I\u2019m much stronger now, though. The last surgery I had was eight months ago, and I probably won\u2019t have to have any more for another couple of years.Mom homeschools me. She used to be a children\u2019s-book illustrator. She draws really great fairies and mermaids. Her boy stuff isn\u2019t so hot, though. She once tried to draw me a Darth Vader, but it ended up looking like some weird mushroom-shaped robot. I haven\u2019t seen her draw anything in a long time. I think she\u2019s too busy taking care of me and Via.I can\u2019t say I always wanted to go to school because that wouldn\u2019t be exactly true. What I wanted was to go to school, but only if I could be like every other kid going to school. Have lots of friends and hang out after school and stuff like that.I have a few really good friends now. Christopher is my best friend, followed by Zachary and Alex. We\u2019ve known each other since we were babies. And since they\u2019ve always known me the way I am, they\u2019re used to me. When we were little, we used to have playdates all the time, but then Christopher moved to Bridgeport in Connecticut. That\u2019s more than an hour away from where I live in North River Heights, which is at the top tip of Manhattan. And Zachary and Alex started going to school. It\u2019s funny: even though Christopher\u2019s the one who moved far away, I still see him more than I see Zachary and Alex. They have all these new friends now. If we bump into each other on the street, they\u2019re still nice to me, though. They always say hello.I have other friends, too, but not as good as Christopher and Zack and Alex were. For instance, Zack and Alex always invited me to their birthday parties when we were little, but Joel and Eamonn and Gabe never did. Emma invited me once, but I haven\u2019t seen her in a long time. And, of course, I always go to Christopher\u2019s birthday. Maybe I\u2019m making too big a deal about birthday parties.How I Came to LifeI like when Mom tells this story because it makes me laugh so much. It\u2019s not funny in the way a joke is funny, but when Mom tells it, Via and I just start cracking up.So when I was in my mom\u2019s stomach, no one had any idea I would come out looking the way I look. Mom had had Via four years before, and that had been such a \u201cwalk in the park\u201d (Mom\u2019s expression) that there was no reason to run any special tests. About two months before I was born, the doctors realized there was something wrong with my face, but they didn\u2019t think it was going to be bad. They told Mom and Dad I had a cleft palate and some other stuff going on. They called it \u201csmall anomalies.\u201dThere were two nurses in the delivery room the night I was born. One was very nice and sweet. The other one, Mom said, did not seem at all nice or sweet. She had very big arms and (here comes the funny part), she kept farting. Like, she\u2019d bring Mom some ice chips, and then fart. She\u2019d check Mom\u2019s blood pressure, and fart. Mom says it was unbelievable because the nurse never even said excuse me! Meanwhile, Mom\u2019s regular doctor wasn\u2019t on duty that night, so Mom got stuck with this cranky kid doctor she and Dad nicknamed Doogie after some old TV show or something (they didn\u2019t actually call him that to his face). But Mom says that even though everyone in the room was kind of grumpy, Dad kept making her laugh all night long.When I came out of Mom\u2019s stomach, she said the whole room got very quiet. Mom didn\u2019t even get a chance to look at me because the nice nurse immediately rushed me out of the room. Dad was in such a hurry to follow her that he dropped the video camera, which broke into a million pieces. And then Mom got very upset and tried to get out of bed to see where they were going, but the farting nurse put her very big arms on Mom to keep her down in the bed. They were practically fighting, because Mom was hysterical and the farting nurse was yelling at her to stay calm, and then they both started screaming for the doctor. But guess what? He had fainted! Right on the floor! So when the farting nurse saw that he had fainted, she started pushing him with her foot to get him to wake up, yelling at him the whole time: \u201cWhat kind of doctor are you? What kind of doctor are you? Get up! Get up!\u201d And then all of a sudden she let out the biggest, loudest, smelliest fart in the history of farts. Mom thinks it was actually the fart that finally woke the doctor up. Anyway, when Mom tells this story, she acts out all the parts--including the farting noises--and it is so, so, so, so funny!Mom says the farting nurse turned out to be a very nice woman. She stayed with Mom the whole time. Didn\u2019t leave her side even after Dad came back and the doctors told them how sick I was. Mom remembers exactly what the nurse whispered in her ear when the doctor told her I probably wouldn\u2019t live through the night: \u201cEveryone born of God overcometh the world.\u201d And the next day, after I had lived through the night, it was that nurse who held Mom\u2019s hand when they brought her to meet me for the first time.Mom says by then they had told her all about me. She had been preparing herself for the seeing of me. But she says that when she looked down into my tiny mushed-up face for the first time, all she could see was how pretty my eyes were.Mom is beautiful, by the way. And Dad is handsome. Via is pretty. In case you were wondering.",

            "George Yeoman Pocock",
            "This book was born on a cold, drizzly, late spring day when I clambered over the split-rail cedar fence that surrounds my pasture and made my way through wet woods to the modest frame house where Joe Rantz lay dying.",
            "I knew only two things about Joe when I knocked on his daughter Judy\u2019s door that day. I knew that in his midseventies he had single-handedly hauled a number of cedar logs down a mountain, then hand-split the rails and cut the posts and installed all 2,224 linear feet of the pasture fence I had just climbed over\u2014a task so herculean I shake my head in wonderment whenever I think about it. And I knew that he had been one of nine young men from the state of Washington\u2014farm boys, fishermen, and loggers\u2014who shocked both the rowing world and Adolf Hitler by winning the gold medal in eight-oared rowing at the 1936 Olympics.",
            "When Judy opened the door and ushered me into her cozy living room, Joe was stretched out in a recliner with his feet up, all six foot three of him. He was wearing a gray sweat suit and bright red, down-filled booties. He had a thin white beard. His skin was sallow, his eyes puffy\u2014results of the congestive heart failure from which he was dying. An oxygen tank stood nearby. A fire was popping and hissing in the woodstove. The walls were covered with old family photos. A glass display case crammed with dolls and porcelain horses and rose-patterned china stood against the far wall. Rain flecked a window that looked out into the woods. Jazz tunes from the thirties and forties were playing quietly on the stereo.",
            "Judy introduced me, and Joe offered me an extraordinarily long, thin hand. Judy had been reading one of my books aloud to Joe, and he wanted to meet me and talk about it. As a young man, he had, by extraordinary coincidence, been a friend of Angus Hay Jr.\u2014the son of a person central to the story of that book. So we talked about that for a while. Then the conversation began to turn to his own life.",
            "His voice was reedy, fragile, and attenuated almost to the breaking point. From time to time he faded into silence. Slowly, though, with cautious prompting from his daughter, he began to spin out some of the threads of his life story. Recalling his childhood and his young adulthood during the Great Depression, he spoke haltingly but resolutely about a series of hardships he had endured and obstacles he had overcome, a tale that, as I sat taking notes, at first surprised and then astonished me.",
            "But it wasn\u2019t until he began to talk about his rowing career at the University of Washington that he started, from time to time, to cry. He talked about learning the art of rowing, about shells and oars, about tactics and technique. He reminisced about long, cold hours on the water under steel-gray skies, about smashing victories and defeats narrowly averted, about traveling to Germany and marching under Hitler\u2019s eyes into the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, and about his crewmates. None of these recollections brought him to tears, though. It was when he tried to talk about \u201cthe boat\u201d that his words began to falter and tears welled up in his bright eyes.",
            "At first I thought he meant the",
            "Husky Clipper",
            ", the racing shell in which he had rowed his way to glory. Or did he mean his teammates, the improbable assemblage of young men who had pulled off one of rowing\u2019s greatest achievements? Finally, watching Joe struggle for composure over and over, I realized that \u201cthe boat\u201d was something more than just the shell or its crew. To Joe, it encompassed but transcended both\u2014it was something mysterious and almost beyond definition. It was a shared experience\u2014a singular thing that had unfolded in a golden sliver of time long gone, when nine good-hearted young men strove together, pulled together as one, gave everything they had for one another, bound together forever by pride and respect and love. Joe was crying, at least in part, for the loss of that vanished moment but much more, I think, for the sheer beauty of it.",
            "As I was preparing to leave that afternoon, Judy removed Joe\u2019s gold medal from the glass case against the wall and handed it to me. While I was admiring it, she told me that it had vanished years before. The family had searched Joe\u2019s house high and low but had finally given it up as lost. Only many years later, when they were remodeling the house, had they finally found it concealed in some insulating material in the attic. A squirrel had apparently taken a liking to the glimmer of the gold and hidden the medal away in its nest as a personal treasure. As Judy was telling me this, it occurred to me that Joe\u2019s story, like the medal, had been squirreled away out of sight for too long.",
            "I shook Joe\u2019s hand again and told him I would like to come back and talk to him some more, and that I\u2019d like to write a book about his rowing days. Joe grasped my hand again and said he\u2019d like that, but then his voice broke once more and he admonished me gently, \u201cBut not just about me. It has to be about the boat.\u201d",

It was easy to see why warriors would not only follow him to hell and back, but achieve their objective and complete the trip alive.', 'I was privileged to write a number of books with Dick, and even more privileged to know him. His indomitable courage was a thing of legend, but his sense of humor and his generosity were just as great.', 'We\u2019ve lost an American hero, but his inspiration and example will guide many for generations to come.', '- Jim DeFelice', '---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------', 'I always knew Marines were awesome warriors. What I didn\\'t know until I started working on \"They Called Us Lucky\" was that their courage and brotherhood lasts a lifetime.', '\"Lucky\" follows the men of Lima Company 3/25 to Iraq and back home, through the eyes of Ruben Gallego. It details some of the worst fighting and losses of the Iraq War. It\\'s a testament to the Marine commitment to our country, to the Corps, and to each other.', 'There are a few \"recruiting poster\" Marines in the book, guys who seem to be the stuff of legends, superheroes in our midst. But most are ordinary men who did extraordinary things, both on the battlefield and at home. They too are superheroes, the quieter backbone of the company and the communities they were drawn from and returned to. Reservists - sometimes called \"civilian Marines\" - they proved as brave and capable as any in the Iraq War. I\\'m proud to have helped give them, and by extension all Reservists in the war, some of their due.', '------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------', \"In honor of the 75th Anniversary of the D-Day, I am deeply honored to have worked with WWII Army Staff Sergeant Ray Lambert, a highly decorated combat medic working at the front lines, who risked his own life to save the heroes of Omaha Beach. His first-hand account is called EVERY MAN A HERO, from HarperCollins, which just made the New York Times Bestseller List. His story was briefly narrated by actor Sam Elliot at the PBS special airing of the 30th Annual Memorial Day Concert in Washington, DC. and he was honored by President Trump at the Commemoration speech on D-Day in Normandy. Ray's dedication to saving and tending the wounded and dying throughout his Army career is a story that affected me deeply, and which Americans will be very proud to read.\", \"Here's an excerpt:\", 'A five A.M. on June 6, 1944, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Ray Lambert worked his way through a throng of nervous soldiers to the windswept deck of a troopship off the coast of Normandy, France. A familiar voice cut through the wind and rumble of the ships engines. \"Ray!\" called his brother Bill. Ray, head of a medical team for the First Division\\'s famed 16th Infantry Regiment, had already won a Silver Star in 1943 for running through German lines to save trapped men, one of countless rescues he\\'d made in North Africa and Sicily.', '\"This is going to be the worst yet,\" Ray told his brother, who served alongside him throughout the war.', '\"If I don\\'t make it,\" said Bill, \"take care of my family.\"', '\"I will,\" said Ray. He thought about his wife and son-- a boy he had yet to see. \"Same for me.\" The words were barely out of Ray\\'s mouth when a shout came from below.', 'To the landing craft!', 'The brother\\'s parted. Their destinies lay ten miles away, on the bloodiest shore of Normandy, a plot of Omaha Beach ironically code-named \"Easy Red.\"', \"I've written two other books about World War II heroes that I greatly admired: US RANGERS AT DIEPPE and OMAR BRADLEY:GENERAL AT WAR. This book was new for me, because I learned so much about medics, their training, new advances in medicine that came from Army experience on and off the battle fields. Most remarkably were the stories of the dedicated medics themselves, whose resolve to remain visible always to their troops to reassure them that help would be nearby made them prime targets of the Nazi enemy. Their selflessness, their compassion, and their cool heads in the chaos of war are exemplified by Ray Lambert's memoir, which gives voice to those who were lost to war on that horrific, yet successful day.\", '--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------', 'A master storyteller, NY Times Bestselling author Jim DeFelice (American Sniper) is known for his vivid, raw, and powerful portrayals of modern American military heroes.', \"Now he resurrects the heroes of the Old West in WEST LIKE LIGHTNING: THE BRIEF, LEGENDARY RIDE OF THE PONY EXPRESS, to convey the sweeping drama of the American frontier's most audacious enterprise.\", '\"Fans of frontier history and lore will relish the incomparable stories [DeFelice] relates.\" \u2014Mark Knoblauch, Kirkus Reviews', 'A meticulous researcher, DeFelice drove the entire, nearly two thousand mile stretch of the original Pony Express trail from Sacramento, California to St. Joseph, Missouri in 2016. Along the way, he talked with museum curators, local historians, and historical reenactors of the Pony Express Association, and tracked down original documents to convey the full scope of the historic enterprise against the wider background of the U.S. Postal Service, American finance, the Gold Rush, and the impending Civil War.', '\"DeFelice frames his story with the six-day November 1860 trip that brought news of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s presidential victory from St. Joseph, Mo., to Sacramento, Calif., the Pony\u2019s main route. The ride, including employees\u2019 encounters with feuding settlers in Kansas, bison stampedes, and hostile Native Americans, is rendered in fine, thrilling detail.\" \u2013 Publishers Weekly.', '\"... reads like a wild ride through our western imaginations.\" - Erik J. Wright, Tombstone Epitaph.', 'Excerpt from West Like Lightning:', '\"In the summer of 2016, I took a trip across the Pony Express trail, walking and driving \u2013 far more the latter \u2013 the path the service took. At one point in Nevada, or maybe Utah, I detoured slightly and got lost. I was alone, it was the middle of a warm day, and I didn\u2019t know where I was or, for a short while, where the car was either.', 'Eventually, I found my way to the car. I had no cell service and the GPS in the car also didn\u2019t work for some odd reason. But I knew if I drove in one direction \u2013 west in this case, or what I thought was west \u2013 eventually I would find something like a road, and from that find another road, and eventually find my way to something I could either recognize or pretend I recognized, and get reoriented. Which is what happened.', 'Not long after I got back, I told that story to a friend. \u201cNow you know how the riders felt, all alone on the desert,\u201d he told me.', 'But I didn\u2019t. Not at all. What I felt was barely worse than coming out of the mall and not knowing where your car is. . . I knew people would be waiting for me, and contact authorities if I didn\u2019t turn up. I knew that in the worst case scenario, whatever that might be, I could find help, either by someone passing or a cell signal.', 'Pony riders had none of that. And they lived with the reality that at any moment they might be completely on their own, without any hope of help.', 'That was a reality not just for the riders, but for everyone involved in the service, and pretty much everyone on the frontier at one time or another. Living with that reality \u2013 embracing it \u2013 made them who they were.', 'It didn\u2019t make them better than us, of course; we live in different times, with different challenges. But it does make their lives worthy of study and, at their best, emulation. The Pony flashed briefly across the American landscape, a strike of lightning in a sky often dark with danger and ambiguity. In its history, real and sometimes imagined, we see ourselves as we\u2019d like to be: brave, resourceful, racing against nature and all manner of dangers, with determination in our hearts and a smile on our faces.\"', '\u2014West Like Lightning by Jim DeFelice', 'Delving deeply into the human experience of war, history, geopolitics, and cutting edge technology, DeFelice has written on a wide range of subject matter. His spy novels run the historical gamut, from the American Revolution (The Silver Bullet), to futuristic techno-thrillers (Dreamland and Puppetmaster series co\u2012written with Dale Brown). His military histories capture the WWII-era in Rangers At Dieppe, and the current Iraqi and Afghanistan wars in two memoirs Code Name: Johnny Walker and Fighting Blind, along with the critically acclaimed novel, Leopards Kill.', \"American Wife (which DeFelice wrote with Chris Kyle's widow Taya after he was tragically murdered) is slated to be made into an upcoming television miniseries for ABC. DeFelice also helped create and wrote the storylines for several video games, most notably Ace Combat: Assault Horizon, and Afro Samurai. Born in New York City, Jim DeFelice lives in the Hudson Valley region. Learn more at his websites at jimdefelice.com and westlikelightning.com.\"]}"

The DualSense has adaptive triggers built into the L2 and R2 buttons so you can truly feel the tension of your actions, a strong battery life with rechargeable battery whilst also keeping the controller lightweight. From the success of PlayStation's industry-first Share button they bring you a new Create button feature. With Create, there's new ways for players to create epic gameplay content to share with the world, or just to enjoy for themselves and there are more details on this feature to come. When it comes to colours the DualSense has a two-toned design and a different position of the light bar that sits on each side of the touch pad which will give it an extra pop. Playstation's goal with DualSense is to give gamers the feeling of being transported into the game world as soon as they open the box."

Lightweight materials and low-friction feet offer the most comfortable feeling possible so that your gameplay sessions last as long as you can. Hyperion Fury is the perfect gaming mouse for your computer, laptop or Mac. You can enable and disable the illumination on your G402 gaming mouse. Here's how: Open the Logitech Gaming Software: Start then go to \"All Programs\" and then go to \"Logitech\" and go to \"Logitech Gaming Software 8.55\". Click the Lighting Settings light-bulb icon. Click the Lighting Settings light-bulb icon. In the Lighting Settings window, you can: Turn the \"G\" logo and DPI lighting on and off. Select the Lighting Sleep Timer box and specify the number of minutes of inactivity after which your mouse's lighting will automatically turn off. When a profile stops working in the middle of a game, there are two possible causes. Either the profile is: Not associated with the correct .exe file, the profile is detected in the game launcher or menu, but stops working while playing the game. This happens when the profile isn't associated to the correct .exe file. You can fix this by assigning the game's .exe file to the profile and not the launcher's .exe file or Reverted to the Default Profile, Another application running on your computer may come to the foreground, causing the active profile to revert to the Default Profile. You can fix this by locking the profile assigned to the game.",

            "What Was He Like,Douglas Adams?He was tall, very tall. He had an air of cheerful diffidence. Hecombined a razor-sharp intellect and understanding of whathe was doing with the puzzled look of someone who hadbacked into a profession that surprised him in a world thatperplexed him. And he gave the impression that, all in all, he was ratherenjoying it.He was a genius, of course. It\u2019s a word that gets tossed around a lotthese days, and it\u2019s used to mean pretty much anything. But Douglas wasa genius, because he saw the world differently, and more importantly, hecould communicate the world he saw. Also, once you\u2019d seen it his wayyou could never go back.Douglas Noel Adams was born in 1952 in Cambridge, England (shortlybefore the announcement of an even more influential DNA, deoxyribonucleicacid). He was a self-described \u201cstrange child\u201d who did not learnto speak until he was four. He wanted to be a nuclear physicist (\u201cI nevermade it because my arithmetic was so bad\u201d), then went to Cambridge tostudy English, with ambitions that involved becoming part of the traditionof British writer/performers (of which the members of Monty Python\u2019sFlying Circus are the best-known example).When he was eighteen, drunk in a field in Innsbruck, hitchhiking acrossEurope, he looked up at the sky filled with stars and thought, \u201cSomebodyought to write the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.\u201d Then he went tosleep and almost, but not quite, forgot all about it.He left Cambridge in 1975 and went to London where his many writ-ingand performing projects tended, in the main, not to happen. Heworked with former Python Graham Chapman writing scripts and sketchesfor abortive projects (among them a show for Ringo Starr which containedthe germ of Starship Titanic) and with writer-producer John Lloyd(they pitched a series called Snow Seven and the White Dwarfs, a comedyabout two astronomers in \u201can observatory on Mt. Everest\u2013\u201cThe ideafor that was minimum casting, minimum set, and we\u2019d just try to sell theseries on cheapness\u201d).He liked science fiction, although he was never a fan. He supportedhimself through this period with a variety of odd jobs: he was, for example,a hired bodyguard for an oil-rich Arabian family, a job that entailedwearing a suit and sitting in hotel corridors through the night listening tothe ding of passing elevators.In 1977 BBC radio producer (and well-known mystery author) SimonBrett commissioned him to write a science fiction comedy for BBC RadioFour. Douglas originally imagined a series of six half-hour comediescalled The Ends of the Earth\u2013funny stories which at the end of each, theworld would end. In the first episode, for example, the Earth would bedestroyed to make way for a cosmic freeway.But, Douglas soon realized, if you are going to destroy the Earth, youneed someone to whom it matters. Someone like a reporter for, yes, the",
            "Hitchchiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy",
            ". And someone else . . . a man who wascalled Alaric B in Douglas\u2019s original proposal. At the last moment Douglascrossed out Alaric B and wrote above it Arthur Dent. A normal namefor a normal man.For those people listening to BBC Radio 4 in 1978 the show came as arevelation. It was funny\u2013genuinely witty, surreal, and smart. The serieswas produced by Geoffrey Perkins, and the last two episodes of the firstseries were co-written with John Lloyd.(I was a kid who discovered the series\u2013accidentally, as most listenersdid\u2013with the second episode. I sat in the car in the driveway, gettingcold, listening to Vogon poetry, and then the ideal radio line \u201cFord,you\u2019re turning into an infinite number of penguins,\u201d and I was happy;perfectly, unutterably happy.)By now, Douglas had a real job. He was the script editor for the long-runningBBC SF series Doctor Who, in the Tom Baker days.Pan Books approached him about doing a book based on the radio series,and Douglas got the manuscript for",
            "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to theGalaxy",
            "in to his editors at Pan slightly late (according to legend they telephonedhim and asked, rather desperately, where he was in the book, andhow much more he had to go. He told them. \u201cWell,\u201d said his editor,making the best of a bad job, \u201cjust finish the page you\u2019re on and we\u2019llsend a motorbike around to pick it up in half an hour\u201d). The book, a paperbackoriginal, became a surprise bestseller, as did, less surprisingly, itsfour sequels. It spawned a bestselling text-based computer game.",

As wemoved into a world where people really did think that digital watcheswere a pretty neat thing, the landscape had become science fiction andDouglas, with a relentless curiosity about matters scientific, an instinctfor explanation, and a laser-sharp sense of where the joke was, was ina perfect position to comment upon, to explain, and to describe thatlandscape.I read a lengthy newspaper article recently demonstrating that",
            "Hitchhiker\u2019s",
            "was in fact a lengthy tribute to Lewis Carroll (something thatwould have come as a surprise to Douglas, who had disliked the little of",
            "Alice in Wonderland",
            "he read). Actually, the literary tradition that Douglaswas part of was, at least initially, the tradition of English Humor Writingthat gave us P. G. Wodehouse (whom Douglas often cited as an influence,although most people tended to miss it because Wodehouse didn\u2019t writeabout spaceships).Douglas Adams did not enjoy writing, and he enjoyed it less as timewent on. He was a bestselling, acclaimed, and much-loved novelist whohad not set out to be a novelist, and who took little joy in the process ofcrafting novels. He loved talking to audiences. He liked writing screenplays.He liked being at the cutting edge of technology and inventing andexplaining with an enthusiasm that was uniquely his own. Douglas\u2019sability to miss deadlines became legendary. (\u201cI love deadlines,\u201d he saidonce. \u201cI love the whooshing sound they make as they go by.\u201d)He died in May 2001\u2013too young. His death surprised us all, and left ahuge, Douglas Adams\u2014sized hole in the world. We had lost both the man(tall, affable, smiling gently at a world that baffled and delighted him)and the mind.He left behind a number of novels, as often-imitated as they are, ultimately,inimitable. He left behind characters as delightful as Marvin theParanoid Android, Zaphod Beeblebrox and Slartibartfast. He left sentencesthat will make you laugh with delight as they rewire the back ofyour head.And he made it look so easy.\u2013Neil Gaiman,January 2002(Long before Neil Gaiman was the bestselling author of novels like",

            "To make recording party chat as easy as possible, Chat Link features 1 female and 2 male jacks. To start, plug your headset into the female jack. Then, take the short male jack and plug it directly into your PS4 controller or into the Xbox One chat adapter connected to your controller. If you are using Game Capture HD60, take the long male jack and plug it into the Analog In port of your HD60. Once everything is connected, open up your Game Capture HD software settings and change the audio input to Analog Audio. If you are using Game Capture HD60 Pro, take the long male jack and plug it into the Line In port of your PC Motherboard (This is usually blue in color). Once everything is connected, open up your Game Capture HD software settings and change the audio input to Line In Audio. If you are using Game Capture HD, you will need an additional 3.5mm to RCA-Y adapter so that you can plug into the Component breakout cable allowing you to then connect to the A/V In port on the HD. Then in the same way as the HD60, open up your Game Capture HD software settings and change the audio input to Analog Audio.4-pole 3.5mm (TRRS) HeadsetsThe most common headset, equipped with a 4-pole 3.5mm jack, is natively compatible with the Elgato Gaming Chat Link.This includes but is not limited to:Astro A40Astro A30Turtle Beach P12Turtle Beach X07Apple iBudsStereo PC headsets with 2 3.5mm JacksPC headsets with 2 3.5mm jacks, one for headphone, one for mic, are compatible with the Elgato Gaming Chat Linkcable when paired with a PC to 4-pole adapter.This includes but is not limited to:SteelSeries Siberia V2SteelSeries 5hv2Sennheiser PC360Sennheiser PC350Beyerdynamic MMX 300Turtle Beach X12Non-Compatible HeadsetsUSB headsets are not compatible with the Elgato Gaming Chat Link.Wireless headsets are not compatible with the Elgato Gaming Chat Link.However, certain wireless headsets can include a mobile cable which equips it with the 4-pole 3.5mm jack, where it can act as a wired headset as well.

Dank der Power von Frostbite erweckt EA SPORTS FIFA 20 zwei Seiten der Fu\u00dfballwelt zum Leben: Den prestigetr\u00e4chtigen Profifu\u00dfball und mit EA SPORTS VOLTA den authentischen Stra\u00dfenfu\u00dfball. FIFA 20 pr\u00e4sentiert umfassende Innovationen, FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE sorgt f\u00fcr einzigartigen Gameplay-Realismus, FIFA Ultimate Team bietet noch mehr M\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr den Aufbau des Wunschteams, und EA SPORTS VOLTA bringt den Fu\u00dfball zur\u00fcck auf die Stra\u00dfe, mit authentischem Kleinfeld-Fu\u00dfball.VOLTA FOOTBALL\u2022 EA SPORTS VOLTA bringt den Fu\u00dfball zur\u00fcck auf die Stra\u00dfe und beinhaltet die authentische Kultur, die Kreativit\u00e4t und das Flair des Kleinfeld-Fu\u00dfballs. Erschaffe deinen Charakter, finde deinen Style und erlebe mehrere Freestyle-Fu\u00dfball-Varianten in Spielumgebungen rund um den Globus.\u2022 VOLTA-Gameplay: Definiere deinen Spielstil mit einem v\u00f6llig neuen Gameplay-System auf der Grundlage eines realistischen Fu\u00dfballerlebnisses. Inspiriert wurde das Ganze von authentischem Kleinfeld-Fu\u00dfball auf der Stra\u00dfe, in Cages und auf Futsal-Pl\u00e4tzen aus aller Welt. Das VOLTA-Gameplay bietet neue Tools, mit denen du in den Flow der Stra\u00dfe eintauchen kannst, darunter vereinfachte Flicks und Spezialbewegungen, neue Flair-Animationen und sogar die Option, W\u00e4nde ins Spiel einzubeziehen.\u2022 Spieler: In VOLTA findest du schier endlose Anpassungs- und Individualisierungsoptionen f\u00fcr deinen Spieler, von Outfits \u00fcber Frisuren und Tattoos bis hin zu Jubelemotionen. Erstelle deinen Spieler oder deine Spielerin und tritt in den diversen VOLTA-Spielmodi an.\u2022 Modi: VOLTA-Anstoss, VOLTA World, VOLTA-Story, VOLTA-LigaGAMEPLAY\u2022 Freu dich mit FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE auf v\u00f6llig neuartigen Fu\u00dfball-Realismus. FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE erf\u00fcllt jeden einzelnen Moment auf dem Rasen mit Leben: Egal ob mit Ball, ohne Ball oder auf den Ball selbst bezogen. Dies basiert auf 3 zentralen Grundpfeilern: Entscheidungsmomente (mit Ball), Authentischer Spielfluss (ohne Ball) und Ballphysik (auf den Ball selbst bezogen). Der Benutzer steht so in jeder Partie im Mittelpunkt.\u2022 Authentischer Spielfluss: Ein Verst\u00e4ndnis der Zeit, des Raums und der Position sind grundlegende Voraussetzungen eines Weltklassefu\u00dfballers. Dank des Authentischen Spielflusses ber\u00fccksichtigt jeder KI-Spieler diese Elemente, sodass ein Spielerlebnis mit noch mehr Zeit und noch mehr R\u00e4umen entsteht und dem benutzergesteuerten Spiel noch gr\u00f6\u00dfere Bedeutung zukommt.\u2022 Entscheidungsmomente: Ein Fu\u00dfballspiel besteht aus verschiedenen entscheidenden Momenten, die das Resultat einer Partie bestimmen. Spiele werden durch benutzergesteuerte Entscheidungsmomente gewonnen oder verloren, vom Composed Finishing vor dem gegnerischen Tor bis hin zum Controlled Tackling vor dem eigenen Tor.\u2022 Ballphysik: Der Ball ist die dritte dynamische Komponente eines Fu\u00dfballspiels. Das Ballphysik-System sorgt im Gameplay f\u00fcr neuartigen Realismus, mit neuen Schuss-Flugbahnen, noch realistischeren Zweik\u00e4mpfen und physikbasiertem Verhalten.UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE, UEFA EUROPA LEAGUE & UEFA SUPER CUPMit der UEFA Champions League, Europa League und dem Super Cup werden in FIFA 20 erneut die prestigetr\u00e4chtigsten Club-Wettbewerbe der Welt durch authentische UEFA-Elemente wie den offiziellen \u00dcbertragungspaketen, Trikotlogos, Spielb\u00e4llen und den ikonischen Troph\u00e4en zum Leben erweckt und einer Vielzahl an Spielmodi hinzugef\u00fcgt wie FIFA 20 Ultimate Team, dem Karrieremodus, einem eigenst\u00e4ndigen Champions League-Modus und mehr.Spiel komplett in Deutsch!"

            "Developed by series creator Rockstar North, Grand Theft Auto V is the largest and most ambitious title in the series to date. Grand Theft Auto V delivers a world of unprecedented scale and detail bursting with life, from mountaintops to the depths of the ocean. Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life."

            "From Publishers Weekly",
            "Starred Review. Two hauntingly similar boys take starkly different paths in this searing tale of the ghetto. Moore, an investment banker, Rhodes scholar, and former aide to Condoleezza Rice, was intrigued when he learned that another Wes Moore, his age and from the same area of Greater Baltimore, was wanted for killing a cop. Meeting his double and delving into his life reveals deeper likenesses: raised in fatherless families and poor black neighborhoods, both felt the lure of the money and status to be gained from dealing drugs. That the author resisted the criminal underworld while the other Wes drifted into it is chalked up less to character than to the influence of relatives, mentors, and expectations that pushed against his own delinquent impulses, to the point of exiling him to military school. Moore writes with subtlety and insight about the plight of ghetto youth, viewing it from inside and out; he probes beneath the pathologies to reveal the pressures\u2014poverty, a lack of prospects, the need to respond to violence with greater violence\u2014that propelled the other Wes to his doom. The result is a moving exploration of roads not taken.",

            "*Starred Review* In 2000, Wes Moore had recently been named a Rhodes Scholar in his final year of college at Johns Hopkins University when he read a newspaper article about another Wes Moore who was on his way to prison. It turned out that the two of them had much in common, both young black men raised in inner-city neighborhoods by single mothers. Stunned by the similarities in their names and backgrounds and the differences in their ultimate fates, the author eventually contacted the other Wes Moore and began a long relationship. Moore visited his namesake in prison; he was serving a life sentence, convicted for his role in an armed robbery that resulted in the killing of an off-duty policeman. Growing up, both men were subject to the pitfalls of urban youth: racism, rebellion, violence, drug use, and dealing. The author examines eight years in the lives of both Wes Moores to explore the factors and choices that led one to a Rhodes scholarship, military service, and a White House fellowship, and the other to drug dealing, prison, and eventual conversion to the Muslim faith, with both sharing a gritty sense of realism about their pasts. Moore ends this haunting look at two lives with a call to action and a detailed resource guide. --Vanessa Bush",

            "Is Daddy Coming with Us?1982Nikki and I would play this game: I would sit on the living room chair while Nikki deeply inhaled and then blew directly in my face, eliciting hysterical laughs on both sides. This was our ritual. It always ended with me jabbing playfully at her face. She\u2019d run away and bait me to give chase. Most times before today I never came close to catching her. But today, I caught her and realized, like a dog chasing a car, I had no idea what to do. So, in the spirit of three-year-old boys everywhere who\u2019ve run out of better ideas, I decided to punch her. Of course my mother walked into the room right as I swung and connected.The yell startled me, but her eyes are what I remember.\u201cGet up to your damn room\u201d came my mother\u2019s command from the doorway. \u201cI told you, don\u2019t you ever put your hands on a woman!\u201dI looked up, confused, as she quickly closed the distance between us.My mother had what we called \u201cThomas hands,\u201d a tag derived from her maiden name: hands that hit so hard you had to be hit only once to know you never wanted to be hit again. The nickname began generations ago, but each generation took on the mantle of justifying it. Those hands were now reaching for me. Her eyes told me it was time to get moving.I darted up the stairs, still unsure about what I\u2019d done so terribly wrong. I headed to the bedroom I shared with my baby sister, Shani. Our room was tiny, barely big enough for my small bed and her crib. There was no place to hide. I was running in circles, frantic to find a way to conceal myself. And still trying to comprehend why I was in so much trouble. I couldn\u2019t even figure out the meaning of half the words my mother was using.In a panic, I kicked the door shut behind me just as her voice reached the second floor. \u201cAnd don\u2019t let me hear you slam that\u2014\u201d Boom! I stared for a moment at the closed door, knowing it would soon be flying open again. I sat in the middle of the room, next to my sister\u2019s empty crib, awaiting my fate.Then, deliverance.\u201cJoy, you can\u2019t get on him like that.\u201d My father\u2019s baritone voice drifted up through the thin floor. \u201cHe\u2019s only three. He doesn\u2019t even understand what he did wrong. Do you really think he knows what a woman beater is?\u201dMy father was in the living room, ten feet from where the incident began. He was a very slender six foot two with a bushy mustache and a neatly shaped afro. It wasn\u2019t his style to yell. When he heard my mother\u2019s outburst, he rose from his chair, his eyes widening in confusion. My mother slowly reeled herself in. But she wasn\u2019t completely mollified.\u201cWes, he needs to learn what is acceptable and what is not!\u201d My father agreed, but with a gentle laugh, reminded her that cursing at a young boy wasn\u2019t the most effective way of making a point. I was saved, for the moment.My first name, Westley, is my father\u2019s. I have two middle names, a compromise between my parents. My father loved the sound and meaning of Watende, a Shona word that means \u201crevenge will not be sought,\u201d a concept that aligned with his gentle spirit. My mother objected. Watende sounded too big, too complicated for such a tiny baby. It wasn\u2019t until later in life that she understood why it was so important to my father that Watende be a part of me. Instead, she lobbied for Omari, which means \u201cthe highest.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what was easier or less lofty about that name, but I was well into elementary school before I became comfortable spelling either.My parents\u2019 debate continued downstairs, but their words faded. I went to the room\u2019s only window and looked out on the world. My older sister, Nikki, and I loved to look through the window as families arrived at the swap market across the street. Our home was on a busy street that sat right on the border of Maryland and Washington, D.C., stuck confusingly between two different municipal jurisdictions, a fact that would become very significant in the near future. I pulled back the thin diaphanous curtain that covered the windows and spotted my friend Ayana outside with her mother. She was half Iranian and half Italian, with long, dark hair and warm eyes that always fascinated me. They were light green, unlike the eyes of anyone else I knew, and they twinkled as if they held stars. I wanted to tap on the window to say hello as she walked past our house to the tenement building next door. But I was afraid of making more trouble for myself, so I just smiled.On the dresser by the window sat a framed picture of me with Nikki. I sat on her lap with my arm wrapped around her neck, a goofy smile on my face. Nikki is seven years older, so in the picture she was nine and I was barely two. Colorful beads capped the braided tips of her hair, a style she shared with my mother, and large, black-framed eyeglasses covered half of her face.Nikki\u2019s real name was Joy, like my mom\u2019s, but everyone called her Nikki. My mother was obsessed with the poet Nikki Giovanni, in love with her unabashed feminine strength and her reconciliation of love and revolution. I spent nearly every waking moment around Nikki, and I loved her dearly. But sibling relationships are often fraught with petty tortures. I hadn\u2019t wanted to hurt her. But I had.At the time, I couldn\u2019t understand my mother\u2019s anger. I mean this wasn\u2019t really a woman I was punching. This was Nikki. She could take it. Years would pass before I understood how that blow connected to my mom\u2019s past.My mother came to the United States at the age of three. She was born in Lowe River in the tiny parish of Trelawny, Jamaica, hours away from the tourist traps that line the coast. Its swaths of deep brush and arable land made it great for farming but less appealing for honeymoons and hedonism. Lowe River was quiet, and remote, and it was home for my mother, her brothers, and my grandparents. My maternal great-grandfather Mas Fred, as he was known, would plant a coconut tree at his home in Mount Horeb, a neighboring area, for each of his kids and grandkids when they were born. My mom always bragged that hers was the tallest and strongest of the bunch. The land that Mas Fred and his wife, Miss Ros, tended had been cared for by our ancestors for generations. And it was home for my mom until her parents earned enough money to bring the family to the States to fulfill my grandfather\u2019s dream of a theology degree from an American university.When my mom first landed in the Bronx, she was just a small child, but she was a survivor and learned quickly. She studied the other kids at school like an anthropologist, trying desperately to fit in. She started with the way she spoke. She diligently listened to the radio from the time she was old enough to turn it on and mimicked what she heard. She\u2019d always pull back enough in her interactions with her classmates to give herself room to quietly observe them, so that when she got home she could practice imitating their accents, their idiosyncrasies, their style. Words like irie became cool. Constable became policeman. Easy-nuh became chill out. The melodic, swooping movement of her Jamaican patois was quickly replaced by the more stable cadences of American English. She jumped into the melting pot with both feet.Joy Thomas entered American University in Washington, D.C., in 1968, a year when she and her adopted homeland were both experiencing volatile change\u2014Vietnam, a series of assassinations, campus unrest, rioting that tore through the nation\u2019s cities, and an American president who no longer wanted the job. Joy herself was caught between loving the country that offered her and her family new opportunities and being frustrated with that country because it still made her feel like a second-class citizen.At college, Joy quickly fell in with the OAASAU, the very long acronym for a very young group, the Organization of African and African-American Students at the American University. The OAASAU was rallying AU\u2019s black students into engagement with the national, international, and campus issues roiling around them.The battling organization elevated her consciousness beyond her assimilationist dreams and sparked a passion for justice and the good fight.A charismatic AU senior named Bill was the treasurer of OAASAU, and two months after they met early in the exciting whirlwind of her freshman year, Joy was engaged to marry him. Despite the quick engagement, they waited two years to get married, by which time Joy was a junior and Bill a recent graduate looking for work. Marriage brought the sobering realities of life into focus. The truth was, they were both still trying to find their feet as adults and feeling a little in over their heads as a married couple.As the love haze wore off, Joy began to see that the same qualities that had made Bill so attractive as a college romance\u2014his free and rebellious spirit, his nearly paralyzing contempt for \u201cthe Man\u201d\u2014made him a completely unreliable husband. And she discovered that what she had foolishly thought of as his typical low-level recreational drug use was really something much worse. In a time of drug experimentation and excess, Bill was starting to look like a casualty.As the years passed, Joy kept hoping that Bill\u2019s alcohol and drug use would fade. She was caught in a familiar trap for young women and girls\u2014the fantasy that she alone could change her man. So she doubled down on the relationship. They had a child together. She hoped that would motivate Bill to make some changes. But his addiction just got worse, and the physical, mental, and emotional abuse he unleashed became more intense.One night things came to a head. Bill came home and started to badger Joy about washing the dishes. His yelling threatened to wake up one-year-old Nikki, and Joy tried to shush him. He kept yelling. He moved in on her. The two of them stood face-to-face, him yelling, her pleading with him in hushed tones to lower his voice.He grabbed her by the shoulders and threw her down. She sprawled on the floor in her white T-shirt and blue AU sweatpants, stunned but not completely surprised by his explosive reaction. He wasn\u2019t done. He grabbed her by her T-shirt and hair, and started to drag her toward the kitchen. He hit her in the chest and stomach, trying to get her to move her arms, which were now defensively covering her head. Finally, she snapped. She screamed at him without fear of waking Nikki as he dragged her across the parquet floor. She kicked and scratched at his hands.Bill was too strong, too determined, too high. Her head slammed against the doorframe as he finally dragged her body onto the kitchen\u2019s linoleum floor. He released her hair and her now-ripped T-shirt and once again ordered her to wash the dishes. He stood over her with a contemptuous scowl on his face. It could\u2019ve been that look. Or it could\u2019ve been the escalating abuse and the accumulated frustration at the chaotic life he was creating for her and her daughter. But something gave Joy the strength to pull herself up from the floor. On top of the counter was a wooden block that held all of the large, sharp knives in the kitchen. She pulled the biggest knife from its sheath and pointed the blade at his throat. Her voice was collected as she made her promise: \u201cIf you try that shit again, I will kill you.\u201dBill seemed to suddenly regain his sobriety. He backed out of the kitchen slowly, not taking his eyes from his wife\u2019s tear-drenched face. Her unrelenting stare. They didn\u2019t speak for the rest of the night. One month later, Joy and Nikki were packed up. Together, they left Bill for good.My mom vowed to never let another man put his hands on her. She wouldn\u2019t tolerate it in others either.My parents finished their conversation, and it was obvious that one of them was heading up to speak to me. I turned from the window and stood in the middle of the room, mentally running through my nonexistent options for escape.Soon I could tell by the sound of the steps it was my father. His walk was slower, heavier, more deliberate. My mother tended to move up the stairs in a sprint. He lightly knocked on the door and slowly turned the knob. The door opened slightly, and he peeked in. His easy half smile, almost a look of innocent curiosity, assured me that, at least for now, the beating would wait.\u201cHey, Main Man, do you mind if I come in?\u201d I\u2019m told that he had many terms of endearment for me, but Main Man is the one I remember. I didn\u2019t even look up but nodded slowly. He had to duck to clear the low doorway. He picked me up and, as he sat on the bed, placed me on his lap. As I sat there, all of my anxiety released. I could not have felt safer, more secure. He began to explain what I did wrong and why my mother was so angry. \u201cMain Man, you just can\u2019t hit people, and particularly women. You must defend them, not fight them. Do you understand?\u201dI nodded, then asked, \u201cIs Mommy mad at me?\u201d\u201cNo, Mommy loves you, like I love you, she just wants you to do the right thing.\u201dMy father and I sat talking for another five minutes before he led me downstairs to apologize to my sister, and my mother. With each tiny step I took with him, my whole hand wrapped tighter around his middle finger. I tried to copy his walk, his expressions. I was his main man. He was my protector.That is one of only two memories I have of my father.The other was when I watched him die.My dad was his parents\u2019 only son. Tall but not physically imposing, he dreamed of being on television\u2014having a voice that made an impact. Armed with an insatiable desire to succeed\u2014and aided by his natural gifts, which included a deeply resonant voice\u2014he made his dream come true soon after finishing up at Bard College in 1971.As a young reporter, he went to many corners of the country, following a story or, in many cases, following a job. After stints in North Carolina, New York, Florida, Virginia, California, and a handful of other states, he returned home to southern Maryland and started work at a job that would change his life. He finally had the chance to host his own public affairs show. And he\u2019d hired a new writing assistant. Her name was Joy.",

Within three years he was playing to sell-out arenas and had released the fastest-selling debut DVD in history. Now a household name and one of the biggest stars in comedy, John has just completed his third nationwide arena tour. John lives with his wife and three sons in Cheshire and his hobbies include his dog Bilko and supporting Liverpool, but not always in that order."

Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score.

            "Presented by Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA soars to exhilarating new heights on Blu-ray Disc(TM). Based on the Newberry Medal-winning book, this heartwarming classic about the power of friendship and the magic of imagination is more inspiring than ever in this breathtaking format! Tired of being bullied at school and misunderstood at home, new friends Jess Aarons and Leslie Burke escape into the woods, where Leslie opens Jess's mind to the amazing kingdom of Terabithia. It's a secret land where they reign supreme among the giants, ogres and other fantastical creatures they create. Now, seeing -- and hearing -- is believing, as Blu-ray virtually \"transforms\" this imaginary realm into mind-blowing reality with astoundingly rich picture clarity and resounding, spectacularly enhanced audio. Live the adventure, cross the \"Bridge\" as if for the very first time, and allow yourself to be transported with Disney Blu-ray -- the Magic of High Definition.",

            "Based on Katherine Paterson's young-adult novel and filmed in picturesque New Zealand, Bridge to Terabithia has lessons to impart about empathy and self-expression, but the tone is never heavy-handed. Jesse (sleepy-eyed Josh Hutcherson,",
            "Zathura",
            "), a fifth-grade loner, lives in the country with his parents and four sisters, including pesky May Belle (Bailee Madison), who adores him. His strict father (Robert Patrick,",
            "The Terminator 2",
            ") works in a hardware store. Money is tight and classmates make fun of his hand-me-downs, so Jesse finds refuge in running and drawing. Everything changes when two writers and their daughter Leslie (wide-eyed AnnaSophia Robb,",
            "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory",
            ") move in next door. Leslie is faster than all the boys, which initially puts Jesse off, but the two soon bond over their love of make-believe. In the forest, they find a creek that can only be crossed by rope. Leslie names the land on the other side Terabithia, where they imagine themselves rulers of the kingdom. Jesse and Leslie also connect with their unconventional music teacher, Ms. Edmonds (Zooey Deschanel,",
            "Elf",
            "), who encourages their creativity. Despite the tension at home, Jesse's personal life is finally coming together when the unthinkable happens. Will he revert to his anti-social ways or will he grow from the experience? Though aimed at all ages, pre-school students may find Terebithia's creatures frightening. For grade-school kids and up, however, there's much to savor in this smartly written, sensitively acted film.",

            "Product Description",
            "Built for your next victory, your latest achievement and much more is the Turtle Beach Recon 70 arctic camo multiplatform gaming headset. Featuring Turtle Beach latest lightweight and comfortable headset design for hours of play, with high-quality 40mm speakers and over-ear premium synthetic leather cushions that let you hear every crisp High and thundering low while blocking noise. Turtle Beach renowned high-sensitivity mic to ensure you are heard clearly and easily flips up to mute. Finally, the versatile 3.5mm connection makes it perfect for swapping between PS4 and Xbox One controllers, Nintendo Switch, as well as compatible mobile devices. Before you begin, please note: Do not plug the Xbox One controller into a USB port on your Xbox One console while the headset is connected to the Xbox One controller. This can cause audio distortion or connection issues. If you're charging your Xbox One controller, we recommend plugging it into a separate Wall USB Adapter, or charging the controller when it's not in use. 1. Connect the headset to a mobile audio device (tablet, smartphone, mp3 player, etc) and play a song or video you're familiar with. If you're able to hear the song/video through the headset clearly, then the headset is working properly and the issue may be with the Xbox One controller. If you're unable to hear sound through the headset clearly when it's connected to a mobile device, then there may be an issue with the headset itself. In that case, please contact support. If you can hear the smartphone audio clearly, but are still experiencing audio issues when the Recon 70 is connected to your Xbox One controller, but the controller is not plugged in to charge, continue to Step 2. 2. Please make sure your Xbox One controller is fully updated to the latest firmware, using one of the methods detailed here. If the issue still persists, please continue to Step 3. 3. Try the following, in order. Replacing the batteries in your Xbox One controller with brand new, non-rechargeable batteries Try using a different Xbox One controller (Make sure that different Xbox One controller is updated). Replace the Xbox One Headset Adapter (if you're using an older Xbox One controller with an adapter). Restart your Xbox One: If your profile automatically signs in, sign out and sign back in when the console powers back on. If these steps did not resolve the issue, continue to Step 4. 4. Try using the standard Xbox One Headset included with the console to see if you have the same issue. If so, please contact Microsoft. If you do not have the same issues with that standard headset, contact support.",

            "The MM712 30th Anniversary is the next evolution of our first popular lightweight mouse, leveled up to lightweight prestige. It retains all the same benefits: gaming-grade sensor, hybrid 2.4GHz and Bluetooth 5.1 wireless capability, PTFE feet for unrivaled glide, optical micro switches for near-instant input, and ultraweave cable for minimal snagging. However, it does all this while shedding the shredded chassis, opting instead for a seamless, hole-less profile specially engineered to remain <58g in total weight. Responsive, agile, and tactile, the MM712 30th Anniversary truly fills in the gaps of its perforated predecessors."

            "Monster Hunter Rise is an action RPG that will transport players to the colorful kamura village, an all-new serene mountain locale that attracts visitors with its unique culture and innovative hunting technologies. After hunters equip their armor and select from one of the various weapon types, all-new hunting grounds await, including the ancient shrine ruins and more. As players defeat monsters and progress through the game, items from Fallen foes can be used to craft unique weapons and armor that will increase their chances of future success and survival. Hunters can tackle these challenges solo, or with up to three other players in local or cooperative online play. Evolving the monster Hunter series, monster Hunter Rise will provide players with an inventive set of new tools to track down and defeat threatening monsters. For the first time ever in a monster Hunter game, wire-based grappling actions can be performed by using a \u201cwirebug\u201d while standing or in mid-air, adding an all-new level of aerial maneuverability to hunting strategies and attacks. The game will also debut new hunting partners called palamutes, personalized and rideable \u201ccanyne\u201d companions that will provide players with a new set of attack Options, while \u201cfelyne\u201d palicoes will return as support characters for actions like healing."

            "Witness the climactic events of Raccoon city in a completely reimagined Resident Evil 3. This highly demanded follow-up in the 94 million unit selling franchise comes on the heels of the award-winning Resident Evil 2, and completes the Raccoon city story Arc. Resident Evil 3 will also include the online 4VS1 asymmetric multiplayer experience Resident Evil resistance. In Resident Evil 3, S.Toa.R.S. Member Jill Valentine, One of video games' Most iconic heroines, flees a city being consumed by zombies and other horrifying creatures. Built with capcom's proprietary Re engine, Resident Evil 3 uses modernized gameplay to combine action with classic survival horror in vivid high-definition. Jill's harrowing experiences in Resident Evil 3 take place in the nightmarish hours leading up to and following the events in Resident Evil 2, shedding new light on the plight of Raccoon city's residents. Every hope of escape is cut off by another Star in the Resident Evil franchise: the towering bio organic weapon Nemesis. This brutal yet intelligent monstrosity uses an arsenal of high-powered weaponry to indiscriminately eliminate any surviving S.Toa.R.S. Members in the city - with Jill being his final target."

            "THE PARENT TRAP: Hayley Mills, Special Academy Award(R) winner for 1960's POLLLYANNA, lights up the screen in Disney's fondly remembered release of THE PARENT TRAP. Mills stars as Susan and Sharon, identical twins separated at birth. Neither twin knows the other exists until a simple twist of fate finds them at the same summer camp. Then, realizing who they are, they plan a little twist of their own. They switch places with high hopes of getting their parents back together. This delightful and heartwarming comedy will have your whole family doubling up with laughter. THE PARENT TRAP II: First time on DVD! In the full-length sequel THE PARENT TRAP II, Hayley Mills returns to reprise her roles as identical twins Sharon and Susan. Now all grown up, Sharon is a single mom whose 11-year-old daughter Nikki is just as mischievous as she was! During summer school Nikki and her new friend Mary turn into scheming matchmakers when they try to get Sharon and Mary's widowed father together. Not quite able to make it happen, they turn to the one person who can really help -- Sharon's twin Susan!|The movie is based on the popular German children's story \"Das Doppelte Lottchen,\" by Erich Kastner.|Double-exposure and split screen shots -- and a Hayley Mills' lookalike -- were used to create the illusion of twins.|The film was shot mostly in California at various locales including millionaire Stuyvesant Fish's 5,200-acre ranch in Carmel, Monterey's Pebble Beach golf course, and the studio's Golden Oak Ranch in Placerita Canyon, where Mitch's ranch was built.|To this day the Walt Disney Archives receives requests for plans to Mitch's home, but there never was such a house; the set was simply various rooms built on a soundstage.|The Studio later produced three television sequels to the movie, starring Hayley Mills."

            "Winner - Best Animation Film at Fantasporto 1998 (Portugal) Winner - Public Prize for Best Asian Film at Fant-Asia (Canada) IN THE WORLD OF MAKE BELIEVE - THE PRICE OF FAME - MAY NOT BE WORTH THE COST OF IDENTITY Pop idol singer Mima Kirigoe looks forward to a bright new career after she quits her chart-topping trio to become an actress. But when she accepts a role in a sexually charged murder mystery TV series, someone is not happy with her decision. Mima\u0092s life begins to change as she is threatened with disturbing phone calls, faxes and e-mails from a mysterious source. She also discovers alarming web sites describing intimate details and pictures of her new public persona. As she descends into a dangerous state of paranoia, helpless and afraid, some of her associates are now murdered by the enigmatic stalker. Reality and delusion merge into a terrifying world as Mima\u0092s innocence is lost and her dreams become nightmares. Will she be next? In the tradition of great suspense masters, director Satoshi Kon (Memories/Millenium Actress), special advisor Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) and Madhouse Studios (Ninja Scroll), bring Yoshikazu Takeuchi's thrilling suspense novel to the screen, in a tour de force that brings animation to a bold new level. A brilliant psychological thriller which breaks the mold of anime films, Perfect Blue was conceived in 1993 when Yoshikazu Takeuchi (Author) and Koichi Okamoto (Original Producer) approached Rex Entertainment with a 90-minute live-action video project based on Takeuchi\u0092s novel. Production was delayed during early 1994 due to the Kobe earthquake and the decision to animate the film was made. However, given the unique nature of the project it was agreed to employ the best names currently working in the industry. Okamoto and Takeuchi employed Hiroaki Inoue as line producer, who in turn approached Madhouse Studios with the project. Although skeptical of what he initially described as \"no more than a reckless idea\", Masao Maruyama (Mad House, CEO) was inspired by the passion of both producer and author and decided to back the project. Word of the forthcoming production reached Katsuhiro Otomo who had previously illustrated Takeuchi\u0092s work. Otomo read the script and suggested that Satoshi Kon (Jojo\u0092s Bizarre Adventures, Roujin Z); a supervisor on his latest project (Memories) should direct the feature. Perfect Blue premiered at the \u0091Fant-Asia Film Festival\u0092 where it proved an instant hit. Its initial screening sold out within 30 minutes and two further shows were scheduled in order to meet public demand. As a result, Perfect Blue was awarded the Public prize for \u0091Best Asian Film\u0092. The impressive imagery within the film found it\u0092s way into both Darren Aronofsky\u0092s Requiem for a Dream (2000) and Madonna\u0092s 2001 Drowned World concert tour."

            "The newest chapters in the Pok\u00e9mon series are coming to the Nintendo Switch system later this year. Catch, battle, and train Pok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Region, a vast land filled with lakes, towering peaks, wastelands, small towns, and sprawling cities. There is no set path, so you can adventure freely through three grand stories. In one such story, you can challenge Pok\u00e9mon Gyms in any order you desire as you aim for the Champion Rank! Explore a wide-open world at your own pace and traverse land, water, and air by riding on the form-shifting Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Koraidon. Choose either Sprigatito, Fuecoco, or Quaxly, to be your first partner Pok\u00e9mon before setting off on your journey through Paldea.  Pok\u00e9mon in the Paldea region have the ability to Terastallize to gain special power. When a Pok\u00e9mon Terastallizes, a Tera Jewel appears above its head like a crown, and the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s body glistens like a cut gemstone. Each Pok\u00e9mon has a Tera Type that remains inactive until the Pok\u00e9mon Terastallizes. For example, most Eevee will have a Normal Tera Type, but some other Eevee have a Flying Tera Type! When a Terastallized Pok\u00e9mon uses a move that matches its Tera Type and at least one of its original types, the boost to that move\u2019s power will be even greater! Terastallizing holds the key to victory or defeat in battles in the Paldea region.  The Paldea Region is home to a prestigious school where people from all sorts of regions come to hone their skills against each other, be it through academics or Pok\u00e9mon battles. The name of the school, its emblem, its uniforms, and other details will differ depending on whether you play",
