            "The innovative and unique multi-purpose FURemover Broom can be used indoors or outdoors to remove cat hair, dog fur, and dirt from practically any surface including hardwood floors, tile, carpet, rugs, linoleum, concrete, and upholstery. The soft head is made of natural rubber that acts like a pet hair magnet and won't scratch hardwood floors. For carpet fur removal, pull the broom in short, sharp strokes to bring embedded hair to the surface of the carpet. Even expensive vacuums made specifically for pet hair can't compete with the FURemover Broom's ability to pick up embedded pet hair. Flip it over and use the all-purpose rubber squeegee side to pick up dirt and dust on hardwood floors. It cleans up spills with ease. The natural rubber of the squeegee blade prevents water spots even on glass, which is great for wiping windows, glass shower doors, and car windshields."

            "The 3M\u2122 Littmann\u00ae Classic III\u2122 Stethoscope is the latest version of the stethoscope that helps millions of medical professionals achieve their best. The Classic III stethoscope offers high acoustic sensitivity for exceptional performance, plus a versatile two-sided chestpiece with tunable diaphragms. The Classic III stethoscope is used by students and medical professionals alike to identify, listen to, and study heart, lung, and other body sounds for physical assessment, patient monitoring, and diagnosis.",
            "Tunable diaphragm technology\u2014a 3M invention\u2014lets clinicians hear different frequency sounds by simply adjusting the pressure on the chestpiece. Hold the chestpiece with light pressure to hear low frequency sounds; press a little more to hear higher frequency sounds. This time-saving feature allows the healthcare provider to focus on the patient, while the non-chill diaphragm provides patient comfort.",
            "Headset tension is easily adjusted for head size and comfort by squeezing together or pulling apart the eartubes. Snap-tight, soft-sealing eartips conform to individual ears for an excellent acoustic seal and comfortable fit. Eartips snap firmly onto the ends of the eartubes and, for safety, require a significant effort to remove.",
            "Resilient next-generation tubing retains its shape and flexibility even after folding tightly into a pocket. It provides longer stethoscope life due to improved resistance to skin oils and alcohol, and is less likely to pick up stains. Next-generation tubing is not made with natural rubber latex, a benefit to sensitive medical professionals and their patients. And, to play its part in the protection of human health and the environment, the next-generation tubing does not contain phthalate plasticizers.",
            "The Classic III stethoscope is made in the USA for consistent quality. It comes complete with large and small soft-sealing eartips, non-chill bell sleeve, and instructions.",
            "Put the power of improved listening in your pocket with the Littmann Learning App. This powerful app is designed to help users better recognize benign and pathological heart sounds, murmurs, and lung sounds. It reinforces learning by offering self-directed learning modules directly on your phone.

            "Gorilla Super Glue Gel is an easy-to-use, thicker and more controlled formula* great for multiple surfaces and vertical applications. Developed for long-lasting repairs in an instant, the clear glue dries in 10-45 seconds. This super glue gel is specially formulated to absorb drops and impacts. Super glue, also referred to as cyanoacrylate glue, or CA glue, works on a variety of materials, including plastic**, metal, stone, ceramic, paper, rubber and more. In addition to its high-performance formula, we've added an anti-clog cap with a metal pin inside to ensure an airtight seal for maximum reusability. It's Gorilla tough, every time.*Versus liquid Gorilla Super Glue**Not recommended for use on polyethylene or polypropylene plastic or similar materials.Directions:1) Protect Work Area From Spills2) Clean and Dry Surfaces to Be Bonded3) Prepare Gorilla Super Glue Gel: With cap on bottle, shake product, then turn product upside down and tap on hard surface to shake gel into bottle nozzle.4) Apply Gorilla Super Glue Gel: Remove cap and apply a small amount of Gorilla Super Glue Gel to one surface. Only one dab per square inch recommended. Set time can vary based on the amount of glue and type of surface glued. Excess glue can cause delayed or failed bond.5) Secure: Press the two surfaces together for about 10-45 seconds. Note that gaps and uneven surfaces may cause delayed bonding. Wait 24 hours for a full cure.Bottles are labeled by weight, not by volume, and each bottle contains the labeled weight. For high performance and reusability, the glue needs to be protected from moisture. Our bottle, which has the required thickness to keep moisture out, contains the grams of glue as labeled and is flexible enough to allow the glue to flow, making the product easy to use."

            "The compact and sensitive Littmann Classic III stethoscope is the perfect instrument for clinicians who monitor and assess children or adults in non-critical environments. Manufactured with strong yet lightweight materials for hours of comfortable use.",
            "The 3M\u2122 Littmann\u00ae Classic III\u2122 Stethoscope is the latest version of the stethoscope that helps millions of medical professionals achieve their best. The Classic III stethoscope offers high acoustic sensitivity for exceptional performance, plus a versatile two-sided chestpiece with tunable diaphragms. The Classic III stethoscope is used by students and medical professionals alike to identify, listen to, and study heart, lung, and other body sounds for physical assessment, patient monitoring, and diagnosis.",
            "Tunable diaphragm technology\u2014a 3M invention\u2014lets clinicians hear different frequency sounds by simply adjusting the pressure on the chestpiece. Hold the chestpiece with light pressure to hear low frequency sounds; press a little more to hear higher frequency sounds. This time-saving feature allows the healthcare provider to focus on the patient, while the non-chill diaphragm provides patient comfort.",
            "Headset tension is easily adjusted for head size and comfort by squeezing together or pulling apart the eartubes. Snap-tight, soft-sealing eartips conform to individual ears for an excellent acoustic seal and comfortable fit. Eartips snap firmly onto the ends of the eartubes and, for safety, require a significant effort to remove.",
            "Resilient next-generation tubing retains its shape and flexibility even after folding tightly into a pocket. It provides longer stethoscope life due to improved resistance to skin oils and alcohol, and is less likely to pick up stains. Next-generation tubing is not made with natural rubber latex, a benefit to sensitive medical professionals and their patients. And, to play its part in the protection of human health and the environment, the next-generation tubing does not contain phthalate plasticizers.",
            "The Classic III stethoscope is made in the USA for consistent quality. It comes complete with large and small soft-sealing eartips, non-chill bell sleeve, and instructions.",
            "Put the power of improved listening in your pocket with the Littmann Learning App. This powerful app is designed to help users better recognize benign and pathological heart sounds, murmurs, and lung sounds. It reinforces learning by offering self-directed learning modules directly on your phone. You can download the free Littmann Learning App now from the App Store\u00ae or Google Play Store\u00ae. *Expanded content is available with a subscription.",

            "The 3M\u2122 Littmann\u00ae Lightweight II S.E. Stethoscope is an ideal entry level instrument, with a tunable diaphragm, dual sided chestpiece, and reliable acoustic performance. Its teardrop shape makes auscultation around blood pressure cuffs easier.",
            "The 3M\u2122 Littmann\u00ae Lightweight II S.E. Stethoscope provides reliable acoustic performance for taking blood pressure readings and making limited physical assessments of adult patients. Weighing just 118 grams, it\u2019s the lightest of all Littmann adult stethoscopes, making it more comfortable for caregivers who wear their stethoscopes all day long.",
            "The Lightweight II S.E. stethoscope is an entry-level instrument that offers a surprising number of beyond-the-basics features such as a tunable diaphragm, dual-sided chestpiece, and adjustable headset. It\u2019s a good choice for medical professionals such as LPNs, licensed vocational nurses, certified nursing assistants, and nursing students.",
            "Tunable diaphragm technology\u2014a 3M invention\u2014lets clinicians hear different frequency sounds by simply adjusting the pressure on the chestpiece. Hold the chestpiece with light pressure to hear low frequency sounds; press a little more to hear higher frequency sounds. This time-saving feature allows the healthcare provider to focus on the patient, while the non-chill diaphragm and rim provide patient comfort.",
            "Resilient tubing retains its shape and flexibility even after folding tightly into a pocket. Headset tension is easily adjusted for head size and comfort by squeezing together or pulling apart the eartubes. Snap-tight, soft-sealing eartips conform to individual ears for an excellent acoustic seal and comfortable fit. Eartips snap firmly onto the ends of the eartubes and, for safety, require a significant effort to remove.",
            "Next-generation tubing is not made with natural rubber latex, a benefit to sensitive medical professionals and their patients. And, to play its part in the protection of human health and the environment, the next-generation tubing does not contain phthalate plasticizers.",
            "The Lightweight II S.E. stethoscope is made in the USA for consistent quality. It comes complete with large soft-sealing eartips and instructions.",
            "Put the power of improved listening in your pocket with the Littmann Learning App. This powerful app is designed to help users better recognize benign and pathological heart sounds, murmurs, and lung sounds. It reinforces learning by offering self-directed learning modules directly on your phone. You can download the free Littmann Learning App now from the App Store\u00ae or Google Play Store\u00ae. *Expanded content is available with a subscription."

Led by Emma Stone, Academy Award(R)-nominated Viola Davis (Best Supporting Actress, DOUBT, 2008), Octavia Spencer and Bryce Dallas Howard, THE HELP is an inspirational, courageous and empowering story about very different, extraordinary women in the 1960s South who build an unlikely friendship around a secret writing project -- one that breaks society's rules and puts them all at risk. Filled with poignancy, humor and hope -- and complete with compelling never-before-seen bonus features -- THE HELP is a timeless, universal and triumphant story about the ability to create change.",

But she really longs to write about Jackson's domestics, so she meets with Aibileen in secret--after much cajoling and the promise of anonymity. When Aibileen's smart-mouthed friend Minny (breakout star Octavia Spencer) breaches her uptight employer's protocol, Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) gives her the boot, and she ends up in the employ of local outcast Celia (Jessica Chastain, hilarious and heartbreaking), who can't catch a break due to her dirt-poor origins. After the murder of Medgar Evers, even more maids, Minny among them, bring their stories to Skeeter, leading to a book that scandalizes the town--in a good way. Not since",

Industrial alcohol may be used in several general use applications.Duda's Isopropyl Alcohol has a 99.9+% purity specification. If a lower concentration is desired, it is ideal to purchase our pure Isopropyl Alcohol and cut it with water to the desired concentration by weight. Pre-mixed formulas are more expensive to purchase due to the additional costs associated with shipping the water weight of the product. Save yourself money by purchasing our PURE Isopropyl Alcohol.We take great care in manufacturing our bottles of Isopropyl Alcohol. The alcohol is filtered using a nominal 1 micron polyester filter. Each bottle is filled using a calibrated servo liquid delivery system to ensure an exact fill level of 950ml (32.1 Fl oz). Our ribbed caps are tightened to 40-45NM of torque and the Poly-Metal cap seals are adhered to the neck of the bottle using a 5000 watt Contiguous Sealing System.\""

            "Gorilla Super Glue Gel is an easy-to-use, thicker and more controlled formula* great for multiple surfaces and vertical applications. Developed for long-lasting repairs in an instant, the clear glue dries in 10-45 seconds. This super glue gel is specially formulated to absorb drops and impacts. Super glue, also referred to as cyanoacrylate glue, or CA glue, works on a variety of materials, including plastic**, metal, stone, ceramic, paper, rubber and more. In addition to its high-performance formula, we've added an anti-clog cap with a metal pin inside to ensure an airtight seal for maximum reusability. It's Gorilla tough, every time.*Versus liquid Gorilla Super Glue**Not recommended for use on polyethylene or polypropylene plastic or similar materials.Directions:1) Protect Work Area From Spills2) Clean and Dry Surfaces to Be Bonded3) Prepare Gorilla Super Glue Gel: With cap on bottle, shake product, then turn product upside down and tap on hard surface to shake gel into bottle nozzle.4) Apply Gorilla Super Glue Gel: Remove cap and apply a small amount of Gorilla Super Glue Gel to one surface. Only one dab per square inch recommended. Set time can vary based on the amount of glue and type of surface glued. Excess glue can cause delayed or failed bond.5) Secure: Press the two surfaces together for about 10-45 seconds. Note that gaps and uneven surfaces may cause delayed bonding. Wait 24 hours for a full cure.Bottles are labeled by weight, not by volume, and each bottle contains the labeled weight. For high performance and reusability, the glue needs to be protected from moisture. Our bottle, which has the required thickness to keep moisture out, contains the grams of glue as labeled and is flexible enough to allow the glue to flow, making the product easy to use."

Opti-Free replenish solution works with silicon Hydrogel and soft contact lenses. For the best results, rinse and rub each side of the lens with solution for 20 seconds.

            "Make moving feel effortless with the Shoulder Dolly 2-Person Lifting and Moving System. By using the ergonomic shoulder harnesses, movers and lifters can lift without worry by lifting and securing items better than ever. Not only will appliances, TVs, furniture, and all other heavy, bulky items be more secure when using the Shoulder Dolly, but back pain and strain will be avoided by putting the work on the body's strongest muscles and using proper lifting techniques.  Whether you are a professional mover, delivery team, or simply moving residences, you can move large objects while keeping your hands free to maneuver doors, manage stairs, and stabilize items even better without putting the lifting strain on your arms. The adjustability of the strap will allow not only unlimited range of motion for the movers but will also allow for moving and lifting nearly any possible item, up to 800 lbs heavy and 10 feet long. This 2-person system was designed by a professional mover to ease the burden of lifting heavy and bulky objects. The kit contains two harnesses and one 12' long x 5\" wide lifting strap.",
            "From the Manufacturer",
            "The ShoulderDolly gives you a hand in moving the heavy stuff--and reduces back, arm, and hand strain. This 2-person system was designed by a professional mover to ease the burden of lifting heavy and bulky objects. The kit contains two harnesses and one 12' long x 5\" wide lifting strap. To lift an object, both people will slip the harness over their head, place the lifting strap under the object, squat to adjust the webbing for differences in their heights and the weight of the object, then stand up! The ShoulderDolly encourages safe lifting techniques and reduces the risk of injury. Eliminates damage caused by hand trucks and traditional dollies--no more marring walls, floors, doors, or furniture.The ShoulderDolly lifting system makes lifting big/bulky/heavy items easier! By using natural leverage, the ShoulderDolly Lifting System allows two people to maintain proper upright posture while lifting any heavy object. The ShoulderDolly works in conjunction with the muscle groups in your legs and shoulders. The sturdy harness fits comfortably over your shoulders and by using your legs, the ShoulderDolly significantly decreases strain and the risk of injury to your lower back, hands, biceps and forearms. It\u2019s a proven way to move big bulky items, safely, easily and more efficiently than a moving dolly. The recommended carrying capacity is up to 800 lbs, however, that is subject to the lifters ability. Each set weighs 4 lbs. One ShoulderDolly set includes everything you need for two people."

            "Crystal Clear Transparent Gorilla Duct Tape features the strength of Gorilla Tape, in a crystal clear tape that does not yellow outdoors. Made with a heavy duty adhesive layer and waterproof backing for extreme durability. This tape is UV and temperature resistant - great for projects and repairs both indoors and out. Crystal Clear Gorilla Duct Tape is best if used between 10\u00b0F and 120\u00b0F. To prevent fingerprints, clean your hands prior to using the tape and handle the tape only at edge. Use a straight edge (credit card or similar object), to press out fingerprints.For best results, apply the tape to a clean surface. Airtight patches are best achieved on smooth, dry surfaces with the tape on both sides of the repair (when accessible). Tape size should be larger than the repair area, extending beyond all edges. Rub the entire surface of the tape aggressively, especially the edges. NOTE: Surface patch will gain additional strength with time. Crystal Clear Gorilla Duct Tape works best for patching with a single layer. Not for patching inflatables at seams.

            "Gorilla Super Glue Gel is an easy-to-use, thicker and more controlled formula* great for multiple surfaces and vertical applications. Developed for long-lasting repairs in an instant, the clear glue dries in 10-45 seconds. This super glue gel is specially formulated to absorb drops and impacts. Super glue, also referred to as cyanoacrylate glue, or CA glue, works on a variety of materials, including plastic**, metal, stone, ceramic, paper, rubber and more. In addition to its high-performance formula, we've added an anti-clog cap with a metal pin inside to ensure an airtight seal for maximum reusability. It's Gorilla tough, every time.*Versus liquid Gorilla Super Glue**Not recommended for use on polyethylene or polypropylene plastic or similar materials.Directions:1) Protect Work Area From Spills2) Clean and Dry Surfaces to Be Bonded3) Prepare Gorilla Super Glue Gel: With cap on bottle, shake product, then turn product upside down and tap on hard surface to shake gel into bottle nozzle.4) Apply Gorilla Super Glue Gel: Remove cap and apply a small amount of Gorilla Super Glue Gel to one surface. Only one dab per square inch recommended. Set time can vary based on the amount of glue and type of surface glued. Excess glue can cause delayed or failed bond.5) Secure: Press the two surfaces together for about 10-45 seconds. Note that gaps and uneven surfaces may cause delayed bonding. Wait 24 hours for a full cure.Bottles are labeled by weight, not by volume, and each bottle contains the labeled weight. For high performance and reusability, the glue needs to be protected from moisture. Our bottle, which has the required thickness to keep moisture out, contains the grams of glue as labeled and is flexible enough to allow the glue to flow, making the product easy to use."

            "Gorilla tape has taken duct tape to a new level. This double thick adhesive tape surpasses ordinary duct tapes, making the list of uses virtually endless. Made with double thick adhesive, strong reinforced backing, and a tough all-weather shell, it\u2019s the biggest, strongest, toughest thing ever to happen to duct tape. Gorilla tape is manufactured with a highly concentrated rubber based adhesive \u2013 two to three times as thick as traditional duct tape. The result is a tape that fills gaps and penetrates Rough surfaces. It sticks to Rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes can't hold. To us, it\u2019s made the way tape should be: the toughest on planet earth. Directions: use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. It is important to clean the surface and brush off any loose particles and dirt before applying Gorilla tape. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. That\u2019s it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla tape! to retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess Supply wrapped until they\u2019re needed. Gorilla tape works best at temperatures above 32\u00b0f (0\u00b0c). for best results, always apply the tape at room temperature. If Gorilla tape freezes, it will work just fine Once it returns to room temperature. Gorilla tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. Gorilla tape should not be used as an electrical tape. We\u2019ve found that Gorilla tape will last a lot longer than regular duct tapes when it comes in contact with moisture. Click on the Gorilla link at the top of this page to see other quality products from the Gorilla glue company."

            "Gorilla takes epoxy to a new level\u2014the Gorilla Tough level. With its superior solvent and water resistance, Gorilla Epoxy adhesive is incredibly strong and durable for household and automotive repairs alike. The easy-to-use syringe keeps the epoxy resin and hardener separate, so it is easy to dispense and won\u2019t harden over time. The two-part, gap-filling formula easily bonds steel, aluminum, glass, wood, ceramic, tile and most plastics. Plus, it dries in an ideal, crystal-clear finish that makes projects look spotless. Directions: 1. Prepare Your Work Area and the Surface: It is recommended to use Gorilla Epoxy in a well-ventilated area. Prepare the surface: To improve adhesion, roughen smooth surfaces before gluing. Then clean and dry all surfaces to be bonded. 2. Mixing Gorilla Epoxy: Remove the black cap. With tip pointing upward, cut or snap the end from tip of the syringes. With the tip still pointing upward, eliminate air and ensure even dispensing by slowly pushing the plunger until both the resin and the hardener are at the tip. Push the plunger to dispense even amounts of resin and hardener onto a clean, disposable, contained surface. Mix the two parts for about 20 seconds, until the mixture is uniform. 3. Application: After mixing is complete, apply Gorilla Epoxy within 5 minutes. The epoxy mixture will continue to thicken and the bond strength will decrease the longer you wait to apply. 4. Clamping: To reach maximum bond strength, clamp project together and leave undisturbed. Important Cure Times: Set: 5 minutes to apply and position Handling: Allow to cure for 30 minutes undisturbed (no weight or handling) Final Cure: Allow 24 hours for load-bearing weight Storage: To close, pull plunger slightly back. Wipe tip clean with dry cloth and align notch on tip and cap. Close tightly. Click on the Gorilla link at the top of this page to see more fine products from the Gorilla Glue Company."

Introducing Venti Trash Can by Umbra Venti Trash Can is constructed of durable pewter polypropylene so it's sturdy and stable which means you do not have to worry about it toppling over. At the same time, it's easy to maintain - just wipe it clean with a damp cloth. Venti is large enough that you do not have to constantly change the bag, but small enough to fit in almost any space in your home. Venti is especially useful as a kitchen trash can, but can be used anywhere in your home, in an outdoor environment, or even in a commercial space Designed by Umbra, Venti Trash Can measures 35 inches tall by 14. 5 inches in diameter, with a 16 gallon (62L) capacity. It works with the most popular 13-gallon garbage bags (the bag will hang inside the can) draw-sting and flap-tie bags.

            "Silver Gorilla tape offers over-the-top results with its triple-layer strength and outstanding versatility. This double thick adhesive tape surpasses ordinary duct tapes, making the list of uses virtually endless. Made with double thick adhesive, strong reinforced backing, and a tough all-weather shell, Silver Gorilla tape is the perfect duct tape for both indoor and outdoor use. It sticks to Rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes can't hold. To us, it\u2019s made the way tape should be: the toughest on planet earth. We\u2019ve found that Gorilla tape will last a lot longer than regular duct tapes when it comes in contact with moisture. Make sure the surface is dry before you apply the tape, and we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll find this out for yourself. Product features: double-thick adhesive: grips smooth, Rough and uneven surfaces. Tough, reinforced backing: the tight weave contributes to the heft, but Gorilla tape can still be ripped by hand. Rugged, weather-resistant shell: withstands moisture, UV rays and temperature extremes. Directions: use like any other tape. Tear Silver Gorilla tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. That\u2019s it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Silver Gorilla tape! Gorilla tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. To retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess Supply wrapped until they\u2019re needed. Click on the Gorilla link at the top of this page to see more fine products from the Gorilla glue company."

            "Crystal Clear Transparent Gorilla Duct Tape features the strength of Gorilla Tape, in a crystal clear tape that does not yellow outdoors. Made with a heavy duty adhesive layer and waterproof backing for extreme durability. This tape is UV and temperature resistant - great for projects and repairs both indoors and out. Crystal Clear Gorilla Duct Tape is best if used between 10\u00b0F and 120\u00b0F. To prevent fingerprints, clean your hands prior to using the tape and handle the tape only at edge. Use a straight edge (credit card or similar object), to press out fingerprints. For best results, apply the tape to a clean surface. Airtight patches are best achieved on smooth, dry surfaces with the tape on both sides of the repair (when accessible). Tape size should be larger than the repair area, extending beyond all edges. Rub the entire surface of the tape aggressively, especially the edges. NOTE: Surface patch will gain additional strength with time. Crystal Clear Gorilla Duct Tape works best for patching with a single layer. Not for patching inflatables at seams.

            "The Rubbermaid Commercial Products Vented Slim Jim Trash Can Waste Receptacle is crafted to make waste management compliance easier and reduce strain on workers. Constructed of high quality, commercial-grade materials, these trash cans feature 4 venting channels that make removing garbage bags up to 80% easier than traditional straight wall receptacles. By allowing air to flow into the can, liners can be pulled more easily from the garbage can which reduces strain on staff and increases efficiency. 4 bag cinches around the rib-strengthened reinforced rim create quick, knot-free liner changes. Sturdy handles and molded base grips make transporting and emptying contents more ergonomical while the step design prevents jamming when containers are nested. The Vented Slim Jim waste receptacle is designed for superior durability and maximum efficiency."

Advantages This Product exhibit a number of advantages over other restorative materials. Adhesion By bonding a restorative material to tooth structure, the cavity is theoretically sealed, protecting the pulp, eliminating secondary caries and preventing leakage at the margins. This also allows cavity forms to be more conservative and, to some extent, reinforces the remaining tooth by integrating restorative material with the tooth structures. Margin Adaptation and Leakage Fluoride Release Fluoride is released from the glass powder at the time of mixing and lies free within the matrix"

            "Product Description",
            "The Eagle Type I galvanized steel safety can with funnel is used to store, transport, and dispense flammable liquids safely and comes with a funnel to facilitate filling and pouring. The can is made of 24-gauge galvanized steel, which is resistant to rust, dents, and certain chemicals. Gauge is a measure of thickness (the lower the gauge, the thicker the material). The powder-coated finish resists scratches, chipping, fading, and other wear. A flame arrestor helps prevent liquids inside the can from igniting and keep flames from spreading. The spout cap self-closes to help prevent leaks or spills. The cap assembly opens automatically to vent internal vapors. A trilingual safety warning label alerts users to the can's contents. The funnel is made of HDPE (high-density polyethylene), which is resistant to dents, punctures, and certain chemicals. This safety can may be available in different colors (blue for kerosene, green for oil or other combustibles, red for gasoline, or yellow for diesel) to separate, store, and identify different liquids. This product is FM Approved as a safety can used for handling flammable liquids in quantities of 5 gallons or less. It complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard 1910.106 for the safe storage and handling of flammable liquids. It meets National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Code 30, which provides safeguards to reduce the hazards associated with the storage, handling, and use of flammable and combustible liquids. It is Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Listed and meets UL safety requirements.",
            "Hazardous storage cans are used to safely store, transport, and dispense flammable or hazardous liquids. They are typically made of polyethylene, 24-gauge galvanized steel, or 24-gauge stainless steel. (Gauge is a measure of thickness; the lower the gauge, the thicker the material.) Hazardous storage cans come in a variety of styles, such as Type I cans, which have a single spout for filling and pouring, and Type II cans, which have a flexible metal hose for pouring and a second opening for filling. They are often color-coded for different liquids (for instance, red cans for gasoline, blue cans for kerosene, yellow cans for diesel fuel, or green cans for oil). Other common features include flame arrestors, which help prevent the liquid inside the can from igniting, and seam welds, which help prevent leaks. Certain hazardous storage cans are FM Approved, and many meet National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for the storage and handling of flammable liquids. Hazardous storage cans are used in a variety of commercial and industrial environments and can also be suitable for home use.",

The water activated polyurethane formula expands into materials to form an incredibly strong bond to virtually anything making Gorilla Glue your solution for almost any project or repair.",

For non-porous surfaces (glass & metal) and dense hardwoods, scratch up surfaces first and lightly dampen both surfaces prior to gluing. Do not add water to bottle.2. Glue It: Spread a thin layer of glue on other surface. Do not over-apply glue. Gorilla Glue will foam 3 to 4 times in volume. 3. Clamp It: Clamp objects together for 1-2 hours. You can use heavy objects to achieve clamping pressure. Strength of bond line improves with better clamping. Full cure in 24 hours",
            "Storage: After each use, wipe nozzle clean with a dry cloth and tightly replace lid. For bottle sizes 4 oz. and larger, we suggest squeezing excess air out of the bottle. While still squeezing, tightly replace the cap and then store in a cool, dry place. This helps eliminate moisture in the bottle. Store in a cool, dry place. Store away from children and animals.",

            "This wash bottle is used to wash labware and to store washing solutions, such as acetone or deionized water. The LDPE (low-density polyethylene) body is lightweight, flexible, and elastic, has an opaque hue, and resists impact, stress cracks, and moisture absorption. Its Boston round shape is used for applications that require a rounded body, short neck, and narrow mouth to store liquid samples, solvents, and chemicals, and dry materials. The screw closure has its stem and draw tube molded in one piece for leak-proof applications, and its angled dispensing nozzle directs the stream of liquid. The spout can be cut back to increase the flow of washing solution. This bottle is suitable for storing and transporting labware washing solutions.   Lab bottles are used to store, hold, and mix liquids, powders, and other substances in a wide variety of scientific industries. Lab bottles have a more pronounced neck and shoulder than jars. Lab bottles are manufactured with a combination of characteristics in order to meet the demands of particular applications, such as for solution dispensing, mixing, and weighing, and use in centrifuge operations. They come in many shapes for specific applications, with a variety of mouth or nozzle shapes and sizes for specific use. Lab bottles are made from materials, such as glass (borosilicate or soda-lime) and an array of plastics, which are selected for chemical and thermal expansion resistance, transparency, and their adaptability in a variety of applications. Lab bottle interiors, caps, and lids are often lined with a protective material. Caps and lids help seal bottles to prevent solutions from spilling. The capacity refers to the fluid amount held by a lab bottle, and is commonly measured in milliliters (mL) and liters (l), and sometimes in ounces (oz). Lab bottles are suitable for use in chemistry and biology applications, as well as in pharmaceutical and scientific testing."

            "Its high strength and quick set time make Gorilla Super Glue the go-to adhesive for a variety of household projects. Developed for long-lasting repairs in an instant, the clear glue dries in 10-45 seconds. Our Super Glue is reinforced for increased impact resistance to handle bumps and drops. We call it Impact-Tough\u00ae because the reliable bond stands up to wear and tear. Super glue, also referred to as cyanoacrylate glue, or CA glue, works on a variety of materials, including plastic*, metal, stone, ceramic, paper, rubber and more. In addition to Gorilla Super Glue's high-performance cyanoacrylate formula, we've added an anti-clog cap with a metal pin inside ensuring an airtight seal for maximum reusability. It's Gorilla tough, every time.",
            "*Not recommended for use on polyethylene or polypropylene plastic or similar materials.",
            "Directions:1) Protect Work Area From Spills2) Clean and Dry Surfaces to Be Bonded3) Apply Gorilla Super Glue Gel: Remove cap and apply a small amount of Gorilla Super Glue Gel to one surface. Only one dab per square inch recommended. Set time can vary based on the amount of glue and type of surface glued. Excess glue can cause delayed or failed bond.4) Secure: Press the two surfaces together for about 10-45 seconds. Note that gaps and uneven surfaces may cause delayed bonding. Wait 24 hours for a full cure.",
            "Bottles are labeled by weight, not by volume, and each bottle contains the labeled weight. For high performance and reusability, the glue needs to be protected from moisture; therefore we package our glue in thick plastic bottles. If our thick bottle was sized smaller to allow a higher fill level to completely full, it would be extremely stiff and difficult to squeeze the glue from the bottle. Our bottle, which has the required thickness to keep moisture out, contains the grams of glue as labeled and is flexible enough to allow the glue to flow, making the product easy to use."

            "1. Check the temperature setting before printing, PETG filaments have higher extrusion temperature than that of PLA; 2. Check if the plate surface has been used for a long time, it is recommended to replace it with our new one to ensure a strong first layer adhesion; 3. If the first layer has poor adhesion, it is recommended to re-level the print substrate to reduce the distance between the nozzle and the surface plate; 4. If the effect is not good, it is recommended to try printing the draft before printing.",

            "Our sprayer bottle ergonomic design lets the sprayer rest comfortably in your hand lessening hand fatigue. This also allows your fingers to be closer to the trigger and combine that with a easy, short and smooth pull of the trigger for reduced finger fatigue. Our nozzle can be adjusted from mist to stream or to the off position with just a simple turn. Which saves time and effort trying to adjust your sprayer. Graphics on the nozzle shows you what position you have the sprayer set. There is no \"O\" ring to wear out or leak. The suction tube reaches the bottom of the bottle allowing you to spray all of your liquid out. The internal spring is made of 302 stainless steel for greater corrosion resistance. All of the components used in making the sprayer are the best of quality for a no leak experience when using it. The bottle is sturdy, durable and impact resistant. The ergonomic neck of the bottle gives you a comfortable grip. The flat bottom of the bottle ensures it won't tip over. The opaque color (semi-transparent) allows you to see the contents of the bottle. The large 32 ounce bottle is great for those cleaning jobs, it saves you from having to refill. There is no fluid measurements on the bottle. Our bottles and sprayers are both made in the USA. Bottles and sprayers are hand inspected before being shipped. More information on chemical usage No sprayer is compatible with all chemicals. Our 32 ounce spray bottle is made from sturdy and durable HDPE plastic. The trigger sprayer is constructed using polypropylene, polyethylene, hdpe, mdpe, celcon plastics. The majority of common water based chemicals are compatible with these plastics, but some are not. It is recommended that you check first to verify that the chemical you are using is compatible with the plastics listed. Bottle measures 9 5/8 without the sprayer attached with the sprayer attached the height is 12 inches and 3 1/4 wide at the bottom"

The less porous the surface is (i.e. no wax floors vs. uncoated concrete) the more diluted Oil Eater should be. If the surface feels a little slippery after rinsing, add more water to your solution.Please Note: A part is whatever your unit of measure is. For example: If you were measuring in ounces, 3 parts water to 1 part Oil Eater would be \u2013 3 ounces of water to 1 ounce of Oil Eater."

When the force is parallel to the contact surface, the pulling force can only reach 1/3 maximum.3.Magnets attract only magnetizable materials such as iron, cobalt, nickel and their alloys. It can not attract non-ferromagnetic plates such as aluminum, copper, wood, plastics and stainless steel.",
            "4.The farther the magnet is from the magnetic material, the greater the leakage magnetic field and the smaller the pull force would be. Therefore, the surface paint adsorbed by magnets is also an important factor affecting the pulling force of magnets.",

            "1.Keep away from pacemakers.2.Powerful magnets can hurt your fingers.3.Not for children, parental supervision required.4.Please wear a pair of gloves when you handle them for your safety.5. All magnets may chip and shatter, but if used correctly can last a lifetime.6.The maximum working temperature of neodymium iron boron magnetic is 176 F (80 C)"

            "The AmScope PS25 microscope slide set includes 25 prepared slides of a variety of specimens including plants, insects, and animal tissues used in basic biology education. The samples are preserved in cedar wood oil and sealed with a coverslip to preserve specimens and prevent contamination. Labeling on each slide identifies specimens. Slides are composed of optical glass for clear viewing and are 3 x 1 x 0.4 inches/75 x 25 x 1mm (H x W x D, where H is height, the vertical distance from the lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back.) The set comes in a fitted wooden case to prevent breakage and ease handling.",
            "Slide specimens include coprimus mushroom (cross section), dense connective tissue (section), dog cardiac muscle (longitudinal section), dog esophagus (cross section), dog skeletal muscle (longitudinal section and cross section), dog stomach (section), honeybee worker leg-composite (whole mount), house bee mouth parts (whole mount), human blood (smear), hydra (longitudinal section), Hydrilla verticillata leaf (whole mount), Lilium anther (cross section), Lilium ovary (cross section), nymphaea of apustio stem (cross section), onion epidermis (whole mount), pig motor nerve (section mount), pine leaf (cross section), pine stem (cross section), pumpkin stem (cross section), rabbit spinal cord (cross section), rabbit testis (section), sunflower stem (cross section), Tilia stem (cross section), young root of broad bean (cross section), Zea stem (cross section).",
            "Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries.",

            "Practical DesignOur magnets hook are made of high-grade Nd-Fe-B materials. Neodymium magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnet currently made.They are amazingly powerful for their size and have innumerable uses.Data based on scientific measurementPulling Force: 60 lbsAfter many measurements, we have obtained scientific and rigorous measurements by pulling the hook at a uniform speed on professional equipment.Several Important Factors Affecting the Tensile Force of Magnets1.Only when the thickness of the tested steel reaches a certain level, the magnetic flux through its cross section would be the largest and the leakage magnetic field between the magnetic poles isthe smallest, the tensile energy can reach the ideal value.2.Only when the force is perpendicular to the contact surface can the tension reach the maximum. When the force is parallel to the contact surface, the pulling force can only reach 1/3 maximum.3.Magnets attract only magnetizable materials such as iron, cobalt, nickel and their alloys. It can not attract non-ferromagnetic plates such as aluminum, copper, wood, plastics and stainless steel.4.The farther the magnet is from the magnetic material, the greater the leakage magnetic field and the smaller the pull force would be. Therefore, the surface paint adsorbed by magnets is also animportant factor affecting the pulling force of magnets.WARNING1.Keep away from pacemakers.2.Powerful magnets can hurt your fingers.3.Not for children, parental supervision required.4.Please wear a pair of gloves when you handle them for your safety.5.All magnets may chip and shatter, but if used correctly can last a lifetime.6.The maximum working temperature of neodymium iron boron magnetic is 176 F (80 C)"

        "description": [
            "Gorilla Heavy Duty Construction Adhesive is a tough, versatile, all-weather adhesive. Unlike other construction adhesives, it's 100% adhesive formula provides a long-lasting, heavy duty bond. We call it All Surface, All Purpose. The durable, 100% waterproof formula holds up indoors and out and bonds virtually anything including subfloor, mirrors, trim, drywall, landscaping, bath surrounds, foam board, marble and more. Directions: All surfaces should be clean and free of dirt, grease and oil. Best if used above 40\u00b0F. 1. Unscrew nozzle, cut tip of cartridge, replace nozzle and cut to desired bead size. Insert into cartridge gun. 2. Apply adhesive to one surface in a zig-zag pattern or inside perimeter of the object. Be careful of squeeze-out. When working on rough, uneven surfaces, use enough adhesive to fill gaps. 3. Within 10 minutes, press surfaces together and hold for 20-30 seconds. NOTE: Heavy items may require temporary support. Use in conjunction with mechanical fasteners when hanging large mirrors. 4. Allow 24 hours to cure. Note that cure times will increase with lower temperature, humidity and if bonding non-porous surfaces. Gorilla Construction Adhesive is best if stored in a cool, dry location, with the nozzle attached filled with adhesive. The best way to store Gorilla Construction Adhesive for reuse is to leave the nozzle filled with adhesive attached to the cartridge between uses. The adhesive left in the nozzle acts as a cap and seals the material in the cartridge. If the cartridge is reused within a few days, the nozzle can be removed and the plugged material can be poked out and then reused. If it has been more than a few days, the easiest way to reuse, is the cut the nozzle farther to eliminate the plugged material.

            "Maxi-Cure extra thick CA is the best CA for most plastics, including GE\u2019s Lexan MAXI-CURE is the best choice for plastic model assembly. When used with INSTA-SET, it works better than any putty for modifying or filling voids. It can be carved with a knife or razor blade and sanded and feathered to form a finish indistinguishable from plastic. MAXI-CURE bonds fiberglass, hardwood, metal and rubber better than any other hobby adhesive. For gluing to the inside, cloth textured surface of fiberglass, scrape the area to be bonded with a razor blade or coarse sandpaper before using MAXI-CURE or any other adhesive. It also is best for bonding the tires for R/C cars. INSTA-SET is a catalyst which acts as an accelerator that allows CAs to quickly cure in thick layers by enhancing the alkaline conditions during polymerization. INSTA-SET in a spray bottle is normally used to cure the CA that flows from joints when parts are pressed together. Applying an additional bead of thick CA along a seam and then curing it with INSTA-SET significantly enhances a joint\u2019s strength. For difficult to bond materials, INSTA-SET can be applied to one surface and CA to the opposite surface. When brought together, they will bond instantly. INSTA-SET is formulated with a strawberry scent and activates CA in 6 to 8 seconds without any degrading of the CAs strength, which can occur with many other accelerators. Maxi-Cure is very popular in the archery industry for fletching, which is the bonding of feathers and vanes to the ends of the aluminum and carbon fiber arrow shafts.

            "Its high strength and quick set time make Gorilla Super Glue the go-to adhesive for a variety of household projects. Developed for long-lasting repairs in an instant, the clear glue dries in 10-45 seconds. Our Super Glue is reinforced with rubber for increased impact resistance to handle bumps and drops. We call it Impact-Tough because the reliable bond stands up to wear and tear unlike any other instant glue. Super glue, also referred to as cyanoacrylate glue, or CA glue, works on a variety of materials, including plastic, metal, fabric, stone, ceramic, paper, rubber and more. In addition to Gorilla Super Glue's high-performance cyanoacrylate formula, we've added an anti-clog cap with a metal pin inside ensuring an airtight seal for maximum reusability. It's Gorilla tough, every time. For high performance and usability, the adhesive needs to be protected from air. One way keep the air out of the adhesive is by packaging in thick plastic bottles. Because of this thick plastic bottle, it might appear that the bottle is only half full when new. The bottle is not completely filled on purpose to make it easier to squeeze the glue out. Gorilla Super Glue should not be used for intentional contact with the skin. Click on the Gorilla link at the top of this page to see other quality products from the Gorilla Glue Company."

Through its three product functions of folding, expanding and knotting, it adjusts itself automatically depending on the respective building material. This makes it suitable for solid, perforated, and prefabricated building materials. Its two material components offer maximum power and function. The grey component made of high-quality nylon automatically activates the optimal operation principle ensuring the best grip in the respective building material while the expansion wings of the red component support safe spreading and provide additional support. Thanks to the feel-good factor of the plug, you can feel exactly when the plug is installed perfectly. The anti-rotation feature and the narrow plug rim, which prevents it from slipping into the borehole, ensure fast fixing without deep drilling. The DuoPower convinces both, professionals and do-it-yourselfers all over the world with its easy installation and top holding values.",

            "The 3M\u2122 Littmann\u00ae Master Cardiology\u2122 Stethoscope is characterized by the best acoustic response in the Littmann mechanical stethoscope line; with a tunable diaphragm, dual lumen tubing, and a precision, ergonomically designed, stainless steel chestpiece.",
            "The 3M\u2122 Littmann\u00ae Master Cardiology\u2122 Stethoscope features tunable diaphragm technology\u2014a 3M invention\u2014that lets clinicians hear different frequency sounds by simply adjusting the pressure on the chestpiece. Unlike two sided models, there\u2019s no need to turn over and reposition the chestpiece. Hold the chestpiece with light pressure to hear low frequency sounds; press a little more to hear higher frequency sounds. This time saving feature allows the healthcare provider to focus on the patient, while the non chill rim provides patient comfort.",
            "Headset tension is easily adjusted for head size and comfort by squeezing together or pulling apart the eartubes. Snap tight, soft sealing eartips conform to individual ears for an excellent acoustic seal and comfortable fit. Eartips snap firmly onto the ends of the eartubes and, for safety, require a significant effort to remove.",
            "Resilient next generation tubing retains its shape and flexibility even after folding tightly into a pocket. It provides longer stethoscope life due to improved resistance to skin oils and alcohol, and is less likely to pick up stains. Next generation tubing is not made with natural rubber latex, a benefit to sensitive medical professionals and their patients. And, to play its part in the protection of human health and the environment, the next generation tubing does not contain phthalate plasticizers.",
            "Put the power of improved listening in your pocket with the Littmann Learning App. This powerful app is designed to help users better recognize benign and pathological heart sounds, murmurs, and lung sounds. It reinforces learning by offering self-directed learning modules directly on your phone. You can download the free Littmann Learning App now from the App Store\u00ae or Google Play Store\u00ae. *Expanded content is available with a subscription.",

        "description": [
            "Gorilla Tape has taken duct tape to a new level. This double thick adhesive tape surpasses ordinary duct tapes, making the list of uses virtually endless. Made with double thick adhesive, strong reinforced backing, and a tough all-weather shell, it\u2019s the biggest, strongest, toughest thing ever to happen to duct tape. Gorilla Tape is manufactured with a highly concentrated rubber based adhesive \u2013 two to three times as thick as traditional duct tape. The result is a tape that fills gaps and penetrates rough surfaces. It sticks to rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes can't hold. To us, it\u2019s made the way tape should be: The Toughest on Planet Earth. Directions: Use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla Tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. It is important to clean the surface and brush off any loose particles and dirt before applying Gorilla Tape. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. That\u2019s it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla Tape! To retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla Tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess supply wrapped until they\u2019re needed. Gorilla Tape works best at temperatures above 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C). For best results, always apply the tape at room temperature. If Gorilla Tape freezes, it will work just fine once it returns to room temperature. Gorilla Tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. Gorilla Tape should not be used as an electrical tape. We\u2019ve found that Gorilla Tape will last a lot longer than regular duct tapes when it comes in contact with moisture. Click on the Gorilla link at the top of this page to see other quality products from the Gorilla Glue Company."

            "Gorilla Tape has taken duct tape to a new level. This double thick adhesive tape surpasses ordinary duct tapes, making the list of uses virtually endless. Made with double thick adhesive, strong reinforced backing, and a tough all-weather shell, it\u2019s the biggest, strongest, toughest thing ever to happen to duct tape. Gorilla Tape is manufactured with a highly concentrated rubber based adhesive \u2013 two to three times as thick as traditional duct tape. The result is a tape that fills gaps and penetrates rough surfaces. It sticks to rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes can't hold. To us, it\u2019s made the way tape should be: The Toughest on Planet Earth. Directions: Use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla Tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. It is important to clean the surface and brush off any loose particles and dirt before applying Gorilla Tape. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. That\u2019s it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla Tape! To retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla Tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess supply wrapped until they\u2019re needed. Gorilla Tape works best at temperatures above 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C). For best results, always apply the tape at room temperature. If Gorilla Tape freezes, it will work just fine once it returns to room temperature. Gorilla Tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. Gorilla Tape should not be used as an electrical tape. We\u2019ve found that Gorilla Tape will last a lot longer than regular duct tapes when it comes in contact with moisture.

            "Its high strength and quick set time make Gorilla Super Glue the go-to adhesive for a variety of household projects. Developed for long-lasting repairs in an instant, the clear glue dries in 10-45 seconds. Our Super Glue is reinforced for increased impact resistance to handle bumps and drops. We call it Impact-Tough\u00ae because the reliable bond stands up to wear and tear. Super glue, also referred to as cyanoacrylate glue, or CA glue, works on a variety of materials, including plastic*, metal, stone, ceramic, paper, rubber and more. In addition to Gorilla Super Glue's high-performance cyanoacrylate formula, we've added an anti-clog cap with a metal pin inside ensuring an airtight seal for maximum reusability. It's Gorilla tough, every time.",
            "*Not recommended for use on polyethylene or polypropylene plastic or similar materials.",
            "Directions:1) Protect Work Area From Spills2) Clean and Dry Surfaces to Be Bonded3) Apply Gorilla Super Glue Gel: Remove cap and apply a small amount of Gorilla Super Glue Gel to one surface. Only one dab per square inch recommended. Set time can vary based on the amount of glue and type of surface glued. Excess glue can cause delayed or failed bond.4) Secure: Press the two surfaces together for about 10-45 seconds. Note that gaps and uneven surfaces may cause delayed bonding. Wait 24 hours for a full cure.",
            "Bottles are labeled by weight, not by volume, and each bottle contains the labeled weight. For high performance and reusability, the glue needs to be protected from moisture; therefore we package our glue in thick plastic bottles. If our thick bottle was sized smaller to allow a higher fill level to completely full, it would be extremely stiff and difficult to squeeze the glue from the bottle. Our bottle, which has the required thickness to keep moisture out, contains the grams of glue as labeled and is flexible enough to allow the glue to flow, making the product easy to use."

            "Remember when your workshop was full of clean air? Air-borne dust particulates can dirty up a woodworker's workshop and harm a healthy respiratory system, but with the WEN 3-Speed Remote-Controlled Air Filtration System, you no longer need to worry. This system eradicates these contaminants by catching them in one of the two easily cleanable filters while circulating the air in your work area. The powerful 1/6 HP motor leaves no stone unturned, collecting every contaminant in its path. Quiet system creates 50 to 60 dB of noise and is controllable up to 26 feet away with the included remote. The lightweight design weighs in at a mere 31 pounds. Combine this with the attached carrying handle and eyebolts for easy mobility, mounting and installation. The WEN Air Filtration System collects and releases the air in your workshop after filtering it through both a 5-micron outer filter and a 1-micron inner filter. Easily switch between three speeds of 300, 350 and 400 cfm depending on what the situation calls for. With the time feature, you don't even have to worry about turning off your machine. Simply set the timer and the machine will turn off on its own once the time runs out, allowing you to easily give your workshop a thorough cleanse at the end of a day of woodworking without having to be present. And because this is a WEN Product, your 3-Speed Remote-Controlled Air Filtration System is backed by a two-year warranty, a helpful customer service phone line, and a nationwide network of experienced technicians. Remember when you could breathe easy in your workshop? Remember WEN. Sound Output: 50-60 dB."

            "3M Stripe Off Wheel is designed for high-speed removal of vinyl, decals, graphics and double-sided molding striping and trim. The built-in 3/8-16 mandrel easily attaches to your rotary tool or drill so you can get started on your project quickly. This solid molded eraser wheel uses friction to remove decals, rather than abrasive mineral, preventing scratches and damage to the finish of the car, boat or RV. While the friction created by this decal remover eraser wheel won\u2019t damage most finishes, it is important to ensure that the substrate is not heat sensitive, as repeated friction causes heat. With a medium density rating and high-quality construction, the 3M Stripe Off Wheel delivers long-lasting, reliable and efficient performance in removing unwanted decals, stripes and adhesives from your vehicle. It\u2019s easy to use with most drills and standard rotary tools. 3M Stripe Off Wheel 07498 has an optimum operating speed of 2,000 rpm (+/- 200) and a maximum operating speed of 4,000 rpm. Operating the wheel above the maximum operating speed may compromise the product\u2019s performance."

Installed in parks and yards across the globe, Rain Bird's 1800 Series is the commercial-grade irrigation spray head brand in the world. Chosen for its reliability, heavy-duty materials and versatility, the 1800 Series has first-rate quality built in for reliable operation and long life. Superior components and features make them the spray heads of choice for a wide variety of applications. This sprinkler\u2019s Matched Precipitation Rate allows it to be used in any combination with other Rain Bird fixed and adjustable pattern sprays. Additional 1800 Series features include: Heavy-duty stainless steel spring to assure flush retraction, every time. Exclusive co-molded wiper seal features an encased plastic \"cage\" to provide unmatched resistance to grit, pressure and the environment. Pressure-activated, multi-function seal design assures a positive seal without excess \u201cflow-by\u201d allowing more heads to be installed on the same valve.

Two-piece ratchet mechanism allows easy nozzle pattern alignment without tools and provides extra durability. All sprinkler components are removable from the top without special tools; providing for quick and easy flushing and maintenance. Spray Nozzle details: The preinstalled Adjustable Pattern Spray Nozzle is easily adjusted to the exact pattern required to ensure your landscape is precisely watered with minimal overspray waste.

A physical left edge indicator makes it easier to feel the fixed left edge of the pattern. Non-corrosive plastic and stainless steel construction for long life. Simple stainless steel top adjustment screw decreases or increases spray distance from 8' to 15'. \"Captured\" screw slot prevents screwdriver slippage during adjustment.
