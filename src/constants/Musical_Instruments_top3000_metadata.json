            "Ernie Ball Mondo Slinkys are ideal for players who prefer a heavier gauge with a little less tension on the plain strings (E, B, G).

            "Prolong your tone with the same acoustic guitar strings that experienced players worldwide trust to keep their incredible tone longer than any other string available. Unlike other string brands, Elixir Strings coats the whole string. This protects not only the outer string surface but also the gaps between the windings where common tone-deadening gunk typically builds up in other brands\u2019 coated and uncoated guitar strings. Anti-Rust Plating on plain steel strings ensures longer tone life for the entire set. Who wouldn\u2019t love more quality playing time between the hassle and cost of string changes? Premium by design, these acoustic strings constructed with 80/20 (80% copper, 20% zinc) bronze wrap wire boast a crisp, bright tone with an expressive, vibrant presence. Compared to our original POLYWEB Coating, the ultra-thin NANOWEB Coating allows a more traditionally textured, \u201cuncoated\u201d feel. For a slicker, gentler feel, try the original POLYWEB Coating on our 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Strings, which also feature a more robust and rounded tone. For more of a balance between bold and bright, our Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings with NANOWEB Coating deliver full-bodied tone and sparkling high-end clarity alongside the same traditional feel as these 80/20 bronze strings. Of course, the kind of string you play is all a matter of personal preference. Not sure what tone or feel is right for you? Try them out for yourself, and find your new favorite string from Elixir Strings. For a more in-depth look at what makes our strings so special, scroll to the branded info further down the page. Elixir Strings: Great tone. Long life."

            "Try this experiment. Take some picks of different material and drop them onto a counter top. Notice how they all sound different when they hit the counter. The same rules apply when they strike a string as well. The material and thickness that your pick is made out of can have a dramatic effect on your overall tone.",

        "description": [
            "The NT-USB is a highly versatile side-address microphone that is ideal for recording singing and musical performances in addition to spoken applications such as podcasting and voice-over. It is fully compatible with all mainstream recording applications on both Windows and Mac OS based computers, as well as the Apple iPad using Rode Rec, Garage Band, or any other recording app that accepts an external microphone. Use on the Apple iPad requires a suitable USB connection adaptor, such as the Apple Camera Connection Kit. The body of the NT-USB features a zero-latency stereo headphone monitoring (3.5mm) jack, which allows you to monitor the microphone input in real-time, along with dials to adjust the monitoring level and mix between the computer/iPad audio and the microphone input. A premium pop-filter is included, which fits onto the base of the mic, positioning the filter the ideal distance from the capsule to minimize plosives (hard 'B', 'T' or 'P' sounds that produce a harsh sound) during singing or speech. Also provided is a high-quality stand mount with industry standard 3/8\" thread, desktop tripod stand that allows the NT-USB to sit at a comfortable height on a tabletop, and a pouch for storage of the microphone when not in use. Compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, as well as the Apple iPad via the USB camera connection kit (available directly from Apple) Gain setting: When the gain is set too high, the microphone will be too sensitive and can pick up room noise that can even be heard as a hiss. When the gain is set too low, the microphone will be barely audible. Compatible with the SMR shockmount & WS2 foam windshield."

            "From the Manufacturer",
            "The AKG K 240 Studio is an update of the \"classic\" AKG K 240 Monitor. The new K 240 Studio delivers even wider dynamic range and higher sensitivity than its well-known and widely-used predecessor. The secret to the semi-open K 240 Studio's sound quality is the new XXL transducers in acoustically tuned vented enclosures with circumaural (around the ear) pads. The circumaural pads envelope your ears nicely and reward you with smooth, solid bass and well-balanced, articulate mids and highs.",
            "Founded in Vienna, Austria in 1947, AKG has built a legendary reputation in the professional audio industry for products that perform flawlessly. The reputation of AKG and its celebrated quality are built on more than 55 years of experience, incredible design, meticulous craftsmanship and a clear understanding of what truly sounds right. AKG introduced the K 140 in 1974 and the K 240 Monitor in 1975, which became the most widely used headphones in recording studios and broadcast facilities worldwide. Generations of musicians and audio engineers use these AKG products to create great mixes, hit songs and albums cherished by millions around the world. The new AKG Professional Studio headphones carry on the tradition of these audio tools and are a sound investment that will pay handsome returns with years of flawless sonic performance for professional recording engineers and demanding users of high quality home or portable audio equipment.",
            "Delivers solid bass and well-balanced mids and highs",
            "XXL Transducers with Varimotion Diaphragm",
            "The new XXL transducers use AKG's patented Varimotion diaphragm to ensure extremely accurate response at any listening level. This technology creates a diaphragm that is thinner, more elastic toward the outside edges for more powerful bass response and thicker, less resonant in the center for pure, accurate mids and clear, detailed highs. The large size of the transducers makes the overall sound more life-like and three-dimensional to capture the emotional and sonic content of your soundtracks.",
            "Gimbal-Type Suspension",
            "To ensure your listening comfort, AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a self-adjusting headband with a flexible steel structure to deliver optimum fit for your headphones without any fiddling. The structure is flexible, yet strong enough to allow bending for single ear use and is durable enough to withstand rough handling. A gimbal-type suspension ensures the earcups of all AKG Professional Studio models will conform to the shape and size of your ears without pressing on them for hours of fatigue-free, comfortable listening.",
            "Wear Them As You Like",
            "Rugged construction, a non-twisting headband, and powerful sound allow you to use your headphones on a single ear only or wear them in any other way you may prefer. AKG Professional Studio headphones are ideal for DJ and live sound use because they are durable enough to withstand the roughest kind of handling during transport or on stage.",
            "Detachable Cable with Mini XLR Connector",
            "The new AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a detachable input cable for easy replacement if ever necessary. The cable and headphones use mini XLR connectors for perfect contact and secure mechanical connection. The cable is made of 99.99% oxygen-free copper and has gold plated plugs on both ends including the screw-on 1/8\" to 1/4\" stereo jack adapter for maximum signal transfer.",
            "Perfect for Portable Audio",
            "You need good quality audio for all your listening--including computer, minidisc, portable CD or DAT player--as well as in the studio. Owing to their high sensitivity and wide dynamic range, the AKG Professional Series headphones are efficient enough to be used with these lower level output sources and still deliver the high definition sound you need when working in the studio or on stage. The excellent workmanship AKG headphones are known for and high quality components ensure loss-free transmission and reproduction of high-resolution signals from all types of digital audio sources."

They're robust, resistant to moisture and can achieve high gain before feedback. The XM8500's cardioid pickup pattern captures the source signal, such as a guitar amplifier or vocalist, while shunning off-axis sound.",

And with its tough metal construction and sturdy steel windscreen, you can count on it to come through after countless gigs and studio applications. We've even included a rugged hard case with a mic clip and stand adapter.",

The adjustable strap lets you fine-tune the pressure and dampening of the strings. Quickly slides over the headstock when not in use, and features all soft materials that won\u2019t damage your instrument. No special guitar modification, installation, or tools required - Yet amazingly effective. Used by top players including Guthrie Gavan, Andy James, Nick Johnston, Andrew Gouache, Anthony Wellington, Norm Stockton, Bubby Lewis and more."

            "F-ONE gives wood its life back. F-ONE is formulated using a complex mixture of the finest ultra refined tree and seed oils to clean, condition & protect your fretboard/fingerboard. 100% free of any lemon oil extracts, waxes, petroleum distillates, silicone, and water. We chose not to use any lemon oil because it contains d-limonene, which is a strong solvent that is used to remove paint and glue. In addition, we believe the high acidity levels of lemon oil can dry out the fretboard over time and require more frequent fretboard care. F-ONE leaves your fretboard looking new, playing great and feeling smooth, never sticky or tacky. Our revolutionary formula penetrates & conditions the wood to dry fast and give it a new look for months. We use 100% naturally produced oils and is safe on all unfinished rosewood, ebony and maple fretboards. F-ONE oil is preferred by some of the most respected repair shops in the world.

            "Pursue your passion with D\u2019Addario\u2019s most popular coated acoustic guitar string set, the EXP42 Coated Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings that deliver the ideal balance of volume, projection and comfortable playability. With EXP coated phosphor bronze strings you get the familiar warm, bright, well balanced acoustic tone of uncoated strings but with 4 times more life. These coated light acoustic guitar strings feature plain steel strings and hexagonal cores made of our revolutionary NY High Carbon Steel. Envisioned, perfected, and manufactured by D\u2019Addario in New York, this break-resistant, high-carbon steel wire delivers unprecedented strength and pitch stability. Your strings will sound as good at the end of a show as they did during the first set of the night. D\u2019Addario leverages centuries of string-making experience to bring you the most durable, consistent and enduring guitar strings. Made in the USA for the highest quality and performance, only D\u2019Addario strings are sealed inside and out. Unlike other coated strings that are wound then coated, D\u2019Addario strings feature an ultra-fine layer of EXP coating that is bonded to the phosphor bronze wrap wire and then wound onto the hex-shaped core wire. The result is a barrier against corrosion and a consistent, long-lasting tone. And thanks to the corrosion resistant packaging, the strings are always fresh. The string gauges in this acoustic string set include: String Gauges: Plain Steel .016, .018, Phosphor Bronze Wound .028, .035, .045, .056 Since 1905, D\u2019Addario has been providing artists and players with the tools they need to perform their magic. As musicians ourselves, we have the unique ability to engineer products that inspire other musicians. The D\u2019Addario family\u2019s vision, creativity, passion and tradition have made us the world\u2019s largest musical instrument string manufacturer. We put our family\u2019s heart, soul and love for making music into every string and instrument accessory we create, and we never stop inspiring performance.",

            "The MPM-1000 is perfect for podcasting applications or capturing high-quality audio from vocalists, melodic instruments, percussion, drum kits and more. At the heart of the MPM-1000 is a 18mm pure-aluminum-plated condenser capsule with a directional cardioid polar pattern. The result? A wide-ranging frequency response (20 20,000Hz), high sensitivity (-38dB \u00b1 2dB (0dB = 1V/Pa @ 1kHz)) and a fast-transient response that combine for premium capture and faithful recreation of every subtle nuance of a sung or narrated vocal part - all with minimal interference from unwanted ambient noise. With the MPM-1000, complicated setups are a thing of the past. Thanks to an included windscreen, a purpose-designed shock-mount for mounting to a traditional mic-stand, a tripod stand, and even an XLR cable, all the core tools for seamless connectivity are thoughtfully included for instant recording and creative potential. When combined with low self-noise (17dBA) and signal-to-noise ratio (77dB) specifications, pristine audio capture is assured every time."

Unlike other string brands, Elixir Strings coats the whole string. This protects not only the outer string surface but also the gaps between the windings where common tone-deadening gunk typically builds up in other brands\u2019 coated and uncoated guitar strings. Anti-Rust Plating on plain steel strings ensures longer tone life for the entire set. Who wouldn\u2019t love more quality playing time between the hassle and cost of string changes? Crafted to last, these acoustic strings constructed with 80/20 (80% copper, 20% zinc) bronze wrap wire boast a warm, robust tone that sounds \u201cplayed-in\u201d right out of the pack while still retaining a remarkably clear mid-range presence.

It can be used in practice or live giging situations. Other features: tap tempo metronome, pitch calibration, and a transpose feature for tuning guitars with capo. Internal vibration sensor detects notes by clipping on directly to instrument.The Snark only weighs 1.5 ounces with a very expertly made clamp with rubber gripping jaws. The lower jaw hinges allowing it to fit any contour. Snark tuners will clip on and stay to even Ovation with the angled head stock.

People will even ask you where they can get one because they are so impressive being so small, convenient, and quick to use. Tuning is easy.

            "GLS Audio speaker cables are manufactured with the highest grade materials in the industry. The copper wire is rated in AWG spec which stands for \"American Wire Gauge\". The AWG rating was developed by the USA as a result of some wire manufacturers stating their wire was a certain spec when it really wasn't. You'll notice most imported wire and cable manufacturers will rate their wire in \"G\" or Gauge (not AWG). The \"G\" rating can be used for any wire size. For example: A 12G rated cable may only be equivalent to a 18AWG cable (or worse). There are no regulations or specifications on \"G\" rated cables. How can you determine if a \"G\" rated cable is the same spec as an AWG cable? Unfortunately, you can't unless you test the power loss per foot. Sometimes the weight may be an indicator. For example: GLS Audio 50ft 12AWG cables weigh about 4lbs whereas most of our competitors weigh about 2.5lbs. This may be a result of the copper wire gauge not being true AWG."

The patent-pending Tri-Action Geometry reduces the force required to open and close the capo and applies even tension regardless of neck profile. Combined with the micrometer tension adjustment that ensures the proper force is being applied to the neck of the guitar and direct horizontal pressure, the Tri-Action Capo virtually eliminates pulling the strings side to side and the need to retune during use.",

It is constructed from aircraft grade aluminum making it rugged enough to take a beating, but very lightweight on the fretboard. It adds negligible weight to the neck of the instrument and will not damage the finish.",

            "Our innovatively designed and patented Nomad Tool paired with our small yet powerful Nomad Slim is the perfect team to easily maintain the quality, sound and cleanliness of your equipment. The Nomad Tool extends the life & preserves the tone of your strings while keeping the body & hardware looking like new without any cleaning solutions. The Nomad Tool\u2019s microfiber pad cleans on top and underneath guitar strings in seconds. The dual sided microfiber pad protects the frets and fretboard from damage when cleaning underneath your strings while at the same time cleaning them. The Nomad Tool\u2019s large pad is also great for removing dust, grime and fingerprints on the instrument\u2019s body and hard to reach areas. The super soft, brush fibers on the opposite end helps you guard against dust buildup and provides delicate care for the body, bridge, pickups, saddles, tuners, headstock and more. Trying to clean those hard to reach areas? The Nomad Slim gives you the ability to get in between pick-ups and under floating bridges, floating pick guards, strings on your headstock and more. Cleaning off dust & grime is a critical step before you apply any polish to avoid scratching the finish. The Nomad Tool and Nomad Slim can be used on all electric and acoustic stringed instruments, drums, mixers, computers, pedals and more."

            "Yamaha has always strived to provide sound engineers with the purest possible signal instead of added processing or color to give it a \"signature\" sound, and the MG Series is no exception. Embracing this philosophy of transparent sound, these mixing consoles deliver a level of sonic purity and sound quality that is unmatched in their class. This is where it all starts. Everything you do as a sound engineer is dependent on the quality of your preamps, which determines the direction your mix will take, and ultimately how good it is going to sound. MG Series mixing consoles feature Yamaha's studio-grade discrete class-A D-PRE preamps, which utilize an inverted Darlington circuit comprising two cascading transistors in a configuration that provides more power with lower impedance. Delivering fat, natural sounding bass and smooth, soaring highs, with very low distortion, D-PRE preamps possess an impressively wide frequency range that allow them to handle signal from any audio source without overly amplifying any specific elements of the sound. Having such a pure sonic platform to build on will ultimately save you time and effort by eliminating the need for excessive EQing or additional effects processing in order to \"fix\" your mix."

            "Product Description",
            "We live in a vast ocean of sound. But what is the sound made by a single drop of water? Just a gentle tap with the mallet and the Zenergy Chime emits a powerful tone of singular beauty that lasts and lasts. Sounds like this are often used in meditation and healing, because they help us to focus and redirect our attention to the sounds within. The resonating sound not only calms and refocuses the individual, but can also focus a group. As such, it's an effective way to start a class, meeting, yoga practice or welcome guests to the dinner table. For best results, play the Zenergy Chime quietly, being careful not to dampen the sound by letting the mallet rest on the rod after striking it. Then take a deep breath and listen. Relax. Refocus. Reenergize. This Zenergy Chime includes a keyhole slot on the back so it can be installed upright on a door or wall. The mallet handle slips in between the chime and the wood for safekeeping, and voila, your Zenergy Chime is always ready to go, right at your fingertips! Gift boxed. HOW IT ALL BEGAN. Garry and his wife Diane founded Woodstock Percussion, in 1979 and it remains a family-owned business in New York's Hudson Valley. Grammy award-winning musician Garry Kvistad created the first Woodstock Chime from an aluminum lawn chair he found in a landfill. As a professional musician and instrument designer, he was fascinated by the Scales of Olympos, a 7th century pentatonic scale that can't be played on a modern piano. Garry had the idea to cut and tune the lawn chair chime tubes to the exact frequency of the ancient scale. The resulting Chimes of Olympos was the first Woodstock Chime and is still one of our bestselling wind chimes.",
            "Amazon.com",
            "Tapped lightly with the rubber-tipped mallet, this single-tone chime emits a beautiful, gently pulsating ring that resonates an amazingly long time. The polished aluminum rod is fastened to a smooth, cherry-finished hardwood base that measures 7-1/4 inches in length, small enough to keep on a desk or by the bed. One simple ring of this chime helps stress disappear. Musician Gary Kvistad founded Woodstock Chimes in 1979, and today the family-owned company produces a wide range of handcrafted, precision-tuned chimes. A one-year warranty covers the chime against defects, and all tuned Woodstock Chimes come with a lifetime tuning guarantee.",

            "First released in 1981, Tortex Picks were originally intended to be a high quality replacement for tortoiseshell. Jim Dunlop\u2019s trail-blazing creation became so much more than that, however, establishing its own identity and becoming the new standard by which all other picks are judged.Building on the precision, consistency, and color-coded gauge system he introduced with Nylon Picks, Jim resolved to create a pick with a bright and snappy attack, superior memory and durability, and an improved grip. He chose Delrin as his base material and then spent more than a year developing a special treatment process to draw out its full potential. This treatment process is what sets Tortex Picks apart from all others, providing their unique grip-enhancing matte surface and aggressive attack. Finally, Jim expanded on his previous picks\u2019 color-coded gauge system to create the bright and timeless palette that has become an industry standard. Because we stick to Jim\u2019s original formula, Tortex Picks remain our bestselling pick line. And we still make them at the Dunlop HQ in Benicia, California.With Tortex, Jim Dunlop launched a revolution, and the world of picks has never been the same. The turtle logo is instantly recognizable, and the vibrant Tortex palette has become a gauging shorthand for guitar players. Go into any music store and ask for Green or Yellow Picks\u2014chances are, you\u2019ll be shown a pack of Tortex .88mm or .73mm Picks. Countless musicians across the world, representing every genre and playing style, have chosen Tortex Picks to help them do what they love.Made in the USA."

            "In 2005, the KA-15S came onto the market and became the industry standard for an entry-level ukulele. Before this time there were only cheap toys or expensive, custom ukuleles. The KA-15S made the ukulele accessible to everyone - a high-quality constructed Mahogany instrument with warm, full-bodied sound at an affordable price.

            "The one, the only, the original -- the harp that was there when harmonica blues was born. Made famous when played by every serious harmonica player from Little Walter to John Lennon, Paul Butterfield to Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young and many, many more. The result of over 100 years of tradition and German craftsmanship, it is still the number one choice of top professionals and the most recognizable model all over the world, known for its full tone and wood comb. Play the Marine Band and be a part of history. Available in 12 major keys, lower and higher octave and minor tunings. Reeds: 40 Reed plates: Brass; 0.9 mm Comb: Wood Length in cm: approx. 15.9 This is the essence of the Classic line -- traditional values and cutting edge technology. Extremely precise tools minimize air loss and ensure a quicker response and bigger volume. As always, each Classic harmonica is exclusively handmade. Horner's diatonic harmonicas set the industry standard through their high quality construction, excellent response and unsurpassed tone. Often called \"Blues Harps\", they have been a fixture as melody and accompaniment instruments in blues, rock, country, and folk bands, as well as many other styles of music and musical ensembles. Richter tuning and undivided air channels allow for bending and overblowing the reeds, creating the signature wailing sound typical of the harmonica",

            "If there is a single style of music where the harmonica can be said to have had a formative influence then it has to be the blues. The instrument in question is the Marine Band 1896 Classic, the original blues harmonica and historically the world's most popular harmonica. Its uniquely authentic sound has defined the role of the harmonica in the blues tradition and made it the benchmark harp by which all others are judged. The pearwood comb, arched covers with side vents and traditional HOHNER tuning combine to create the legendary sound which can be heard on countless classic blues recordings from the 1920s to the present day.",
            "A Whole Lot Of History.",
            "In the heyday of the harmonica during the 1920s, millions of Marine Bands were exported to the USA every year. European migrants played a considerable role in the dissemination of the instrument and areas with a large population of German settlers such as Texas or Carolina also produced large numbers of black harp players. The Marine Band was cheap and readily available in any general store, so it became the most widely distributed musical instrument in the USA at this time",

            "Launchkey is Novation\u2019s intuitive and fully integrated MIDI keyboard controller for making tracks in Ableton Live and with your external equipment. The Launchkey experience is designed for players of all types and abilities. With its various musical creation features, Launchkey removes barriers to creativity, and expands the musical vocabulary of even the most talented keyboardists. Eight Scale modes guide you into new musical territory, by transposing keys played to notes in the scale selected. Simply choose your root note and your preferred scale, then play. Three Chord modes transform the keys and pads into an interactive surface of musical exploration, where every note played is tonally and harmonically linked. The arpeggiator lets you explore new melodies and find ideas quickly, while the mutate function reconstructs your patterns into exciting new forms. Custom Modes simplify the relationship between controller and software, with more power than ever in your hands. Programmable using the Novation Components browser-based tool, Custom Modes let you design the behaviour of your Launchkey, with control over control assignments, MIDI routing, pad colour and much more. Launchkey 49 [MK3] is equipped with a full-size five-pin MIDI DIN output, enabling simple connection to the universe of MIDI devices \u2014 new and old. Larger, improved velocity-sensitive pads provide greater control over dynamics, and eight fixed rotary knobs bring your software to life at your fingertips. The integration with Ableton Live is truly seamless, with a dedicated button for activating the Capture MIDI function, plus track arm, quantise, click and loop controls, for flying around your Session faster than ever. Not an Ableton Live user? No problem, Launchkey also has full integration with Logic and Reason, plus out of the box functionality with other DAWs including Studio One, Cubase and Pro Tools, via HUI."

            "The kazoo is a musical instrument that adds a \"buzzing\" quality to a player's voice when the player vocalizes into it. It is a type of mirliton, which is a membranophone, one of a class of instruments that modifies its player's voice by way of a vibrating membrane. It is a unique musical instrument that is extremely easy to play making it the ideal outdoor companion for all ages -- on the trail, around the campfire, camping, hiking, backpacking, boy scouts, traveling, or... that hipster friend who is super into making music but can't really play an instrument.",

            "Don\u2019t let the price fool you! The affordable Ga-1 guitar Tuner/ bass tuner is an excellent choice for any guitarist or bass player. The handy tilt-slit design provides easy viewing; auto power off preserves battery life. High accuracy and superb functionality Have made Kong guitar and bass tuners the worldwide favorite. The Ga-1 is the latest addition to our best-selling GA series of tuners. With even more features, like a Pitch reference tone and quintal-flat tuning, The Ga-1 guitar Tuner packs basic functionality and convenient tuning functions into an ultra-compact body. This dedicated guitar and bass tuner lets you select either guitar mode or bass mode for truly easy operation with automatic pitch detection. The Ga-1 guitar Tuner mode supports string guitars (7B through 1e). the Ga-1 bass tuner mode support string basses (low-B, Hi-C). a high-sensitivity mic is built-in, allowing easy and accurate tuning of acoustic guitars. The ga-1\u2019s Quinta flat tuning mode supports the lowered tunings used in heavy metal styles to give more weight to the sound. Until now, dedicated guitar tuners have supported a maximum of only four semitones below standard pitch, but the Ga-1 gives you five steps of flatted tuning, extending as far as five semitones below standard pitch, and supporting even super-long scale guitars that are five frets longer than conventional guitars."

Guitar and bass players familiar with that end-of-the-gig tight shoulder caused by conventional straps can now find relief with the KLIQ AirCell Guitar Strap--the only guitar strap to utilize patented AirCell core technology for increased comfort and strength.

Woven construction of the 3\u201d wide shoulder pad ensures that the strap will lie smoothly on the shoulder, move easily on clothing or skin, and wick away moisture. The AirCell Guitar Strap, Short, is adjustable from 46\" to 56\" (Regular). (Also available in Short and Long lengths [Available in black only]). To guarantee a perfect fit, please measure your current strap length to make sure it falls within this range. So click the \u201cAdd To Cart\u201d button above, strap on your heaviest guitar and play for hours!"

            "Completely redesigned from the ground up, the TinyTune PS is faster and more intuitive than ever. Utilizing Weighted Pitch Sampling Technology, the tuner samples an average of several points in time, serving up very steady tracking and precise tuning. Featuring an upgraded LED display, TinyTune PS makes tuning more comfortable in any environment, indoors or out. A new relay based True Bypass circuit ensures your tone remains pristine and uncolored, while an electronic quiet switch provides reliable, \"pop\" free switching, stomp after stomp. Improved tuner settings include a wide Pitch Calibration range of 420-459Hz, and a Flat Tuning mode for those that like to rock Drop tunings, down to seven semitones below standard. Finally, the TinyTune PS stores your preferred settings, even after it is powered down. From reference pitch to flat tuning mode, you only have to set these parameters once, and the tuner will recall them the next time you use it.",

He also served as a regimental drummer, and played with several Boston area orchestras. In 1933 he was one of the founding members of NARD, the National Association of Rudimentary Drummers. For many years he also lectured, taught, and judged competitions. His books teach drum and xylophone technique, with Stick Control one of the all-time best sellers in this field.

What is a Condenser Mic? Condenser microphones are the ideal choice for capturing vocals and acoustic instruments. They're the primary type of microphone used in recording studios and radio stations. They are capable of capturing much more detail than dynamic microphones because of their wider, flatter frequency response. Another difference between condenser and dynamic mics is that they contain active circuitry that requires phantom power (+48 V DC) for operation. You can power them from any phantom power equipped Behringer Xenyx mixer, plus enjoy the benefits of our state-of-the-art Xenyx mic preamps. Why the C-1? The C-1 is an affordable, high-quality way to put this essential studio tool to work for you. Thanks to its cardioid (heart-shaped) pattern, the C-1 microphone picks up your source signal while rejecting off-axis sounds that can ruin an otherwise perfect recording. With its excellent transducer and gold-plated XLR output, the C-1 is very neutral sounding and truly delivers on the promise of But That's Not All. The C-1 is built to be your go-to condenser mic for years to come. Its tough, die-cast body can withstand all the rigors of bleary-eyed late-night recording marathons. And with its rugged foam-padded carrying case, it travels in safety and style. We also included a swivel stand mount so it can be affixed to your studio's mic stands.

This will keep them engaged and, in turn, make them a better guitarist in the shortest amount of time.', 'It all started with Guitar Aerobics...', \"The former Editor-in-Chief of the popular Guitar One magazine, Nelson wrote his first book, Guitar Aerobics, shortly after leaving the publication in 2005. The title, which has become a #1 bestseller, has sold over 150,000 copies worldwide and, for over a decade, has remained in the Top 10 of Amazon's list of top-selling guitar titles.\", '\"As a guitarist, I wanted to write a technique book that would appeal to me; that is, a book that had a practical structure and music examples that didn\\'t sound like warm-up exercises. I wanted to compose music examples that guitarists could incorporate into their own music while, at the same time, improving their chops,\" says Nelson.', 'Following the incredible success of Guitar Aerobics, Nelson next penned Fretboard Freedom, Rhythm Guitar 365, and One-Man Guitar Jam, all published by Hal Leonard, the top print music publisher in the world.', 'In 2017, Nelson self-published Modern Lead Guitar, followed in 2018 by Play Blues Guitar in 14 Days and Master Pentatonic Scales for Guitar in 14 Days. In 2019, he released several more titles, including Learn 14 Chord Progressions for Guitar in 14 Days, The Guitar Book (Volumes 1 and 2), How to Play Guitar in 14 Days, and How to Play Jazz Guitar in 14 Days.', 'In 2020, Nelson continued to focus heavily on his Play Guitar in 14 Days series, releasing the titles Master Music Theory for Guitar in 14 Days, Connect &amp; Combine Pentatonic Scales Across the Guitar Fretboard in 14 Days, and Memorize &amp; Master the Guitar Fretboard in 14 Days. He even found time to publish a Christmas songbook, 12 Easy Christmas Songs for Solo Guitar.', 'Learning to play guitar...', 'It was in the small town of Viroqua, Wisconsin (population 4,000), where Nelson first picked up the guitar at the age 14. After months of begging his parents for an axe, he tapped into his savings account for a Harmony electric, a Fender Strat knockoff from the JC Penney catalog.', \"From that moment forward, Nelson would spend hours each day, much to his buddies' dismay, woodshedding in his bedroom, playing everything from Stevie Ray Vaughan and B.B. King to Dokken and Metallica.\", '\"My friends would come to our front door on the weekends to ask me to hang out, and I\\'d say \\'no thanks\\' and go back to my room to play guitar until dinner. Then, after dinner, I\\'d return to my room and play until my sister would bang on the wall to make me stop,\" remembers Nelson.', 'Guitar One History...', 'Nelson attended Milwaukee Area Technical College, where he earned an Associate\u2019s Degree in Occupational Music. Following graduation, Nelson launched his professional career at Hal Leonard, where he worked as a music editor. In 1999, Nelson moved with magazine start-up Guitar One to New York City. For a decade, he worked many late nights and weekends at the magazine, holding the titles of Music Editor, Senior Editor, and, finally, Editor-in-Chief.', '\"I\\'m quite proud of what we accomplished at Guitar One. What began as a start-up, evolved into the No. 2 guitar title in the world when I left in 2005,\" remembers Nelson fondly.', 'Here\u2019s what others have to say about Troy Nelson:', '\u201cI am a total fan of Troy\u2019s books and methods of learning.\u201d', '\u201cTroy Nelson is a guitar god.\u201d', '\u201cTroy Nelson is the former editor of my favorite guitar magazines.\u201d', 'Books Authored by Troy Nelson:', 'Guitar Aerobics', 'Fretboard Freedom', 'Rhythm Guitar 365', 'One-Man Guitar Jam', 'Modern Lead Guitar', 'Play Blues Guitar in 14 Days', 'Master Pentatonic Scales for Guitar in 14 Days', 'Learn 14 Chord Progressions for Guitar in 14 Days', 'The Guitar Book: Volume 1', 'The Guitar Book: Volume 2', 'How to Play Guitar in 14 Days', 'How to Play Jazz Guitar in 14 Days', 'Master Music Theory for Guitar in 14 Days', 'Connect &amp; Combine Pentatonic Scales Across the Guitar Fretboard in 14 Days', 'Memorize &amp; Master the Guitar Fretboard in 14 Days', '12 Easy Christmas Songs for Solo Guitar']}"

            "The Pioneer DDJ-200 is the latest entry-level smart DJ controller with compatibility with Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android devices. The two-channel controller features a jog wheel, tempo slider, cue and play/pause buttons, beat sync, and eight performance pads per deck. The center section is modeled after a standard DJ mixer with a three-band EQ, channel effects (CFX), a volume fader per deck, as well as a crossfader. The headphone selection allows you to cue each deck or listen to the master mix. For the beginner DJ, there are several features to help you achieve professional sounding mixing. Transition FX reproduce various patterns of DJ mixes between tracks, while Phrase Sync uses analyzed track information to align the start and end phrase positions of two tracks. Additionally, help is available for the novice via tutorials and pop-up hints to get you up and running in no time. The controller is packaged with Pioneer DJ's WeDJ software for iPhone and a rekordbox dj dongle for using rekordbox dj on a Mac or Windows computer. The Pioneer DDJ-200 is USB bus powered and ships with a USB cable and a split audio cable, which allows you to monitor the cue outputs of your device while sending the main out to speakers."

            "The Korg MA1 Digital Metronome is a compact metronome that solidly covers all the basics with a broad tempo range and a rich variety of beats and rhythm patterns. The MA1 metronome also shows the beat in an innovative way that makes practicing easier. With stylish design and reliable functionality, this is an indispensible rhythm training aide for any musician.\u00a0 With the Beat-Counting display, the number of triangular icons in the display indicates the specified beat. On each beat, the icon color changes (moving from left to right), indicating the current beat of the measure in a way that's intuitively clear. This provides visual cues as to when measures will change a helpful advance over metronomes that provide only an audible indication.\u00a0 The tempo of the Korg MA1 can be set using one of three methods: increase or decrease the tempo using the standard increments familiar from a mechanical metronome (pendulum steps); increase or decrease the tempo in single-step increments over the full range of 30-252 (full steps), or use the Tap Tempo function to enter the tempo by pressing the switch in time with the music.\u00a0 Practice a wide variety of songs by specifying any beat count from 1 to 9, and choose any one of the eight rhythm types: quarter notes, eighth notes, triplets (straight triplets, triplets with inner beat omitted, triplets with the third beat omitted), and sixteenth notes (quadruplets, quadruplets with middle beats omitted, quadruplets with the third and fourth beats omitted).\u00a0 Sound Out mode on the MA1 metronome produces a reference pitch (selectable over an octave C4-B4) that you can use when tuning nearly any instrument. The frequency of the A4 reference pitch (calibration) can be adjusted in 1 Hz steps over the broad range of 410 Hz to 480 Hz.\u00a0 The MA1 metronome is designed for long battery life, with continuous operation of approximately 70 hours when using zinc-carbon batteries, or approximately 290 hours when using alkaline batteries."

Input and output jacks allow the tuner to be placed in-line between the instrument and amplifier. Or, rely on the built-in microphone and built-in speaker for tuning acoustically. Product Block Copy Bluegrass music and bluegrass instruments require their own special tunings. Settings for banjo, mandolin, fiddle, resonator guitar - plus traditional guitar and bass - are preset. The sharp/flat key transposes the pitch in half-steps, allowing you to tune your instrument while keeping the capo on. For the electric player, input and output jacks allow the tuner to be in-line between the instrument and amplifier. For the acoustic player, the BA-40 can generate audible tones to tune to; and can listen to your tuning thru the built-in mic. Highly accurate, sensitive to +/- 1 cent."

It may issue a hoarse tone, somewhat similar to the saxophone. As long as the player can sing songs, you can play Kazoo.  *You could take it out of your pocket and add to the fun,it's very simply that many musicians and singers use it to be guest appearance.  *Kazoo's structure is extremely simple, the membrane can be changed (be careful when changing plugs do not get it broken).",

            "*Don't blow the Kazoo , just hum. When we put big side in the mouth, don\u2019t blow like playing harmonica.  *You need to hum the tune, the vibrations of the vocal cords make the flute diaphragm vibrate and sound.  *You can change the tone of the kazoo by rotating the lid on the flute diaphragm. When the lid is twisted too tight, its sound will be more crisp. On the contrary, its sound will become hoarse.  *You will be able to find the playing skills soon. You do not have to learn music theory and score, not even have to practice. Just a minute you play the tone of your dreams with Kazoo.",
