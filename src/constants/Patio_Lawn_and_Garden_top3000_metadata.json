Too much humidity can encourage the growth of mold, bacteria, viruses, fungi, mites, and other asthma-inducing agents. Overly dry air can lead to nose irritation, skin irritation, breathing difficulty, and damaging static electricity. Correct humidity can encourage plant growth and assists with the comfort and health of pets. Use this digital hygrometer to monitor a grow room in any location or as the perfect thermometer and hygrometer for a cigar room (humidor) or wine cellar. This humidistat, optical thermometer will help you improve your home environment through the power of knowing temperature and humidity.

            "Spartan Mosquito Pro Tech kills mosquitoes for up to 30 days so you can enjoy the outdoors. Spartan Mosquito Pro Tech also doesn\u2019t require batteries or electricity, just add warm water and shake! Four tubes will kill mosquitoes in areas 1 acre or smaller and areas with less mosquito pressure and deployed early in the season. Refer to Mosquito Emergence and Deployment Map on package insert for product placement timing. Prepare Spartan Mosquito Pro Tech by removing all contents from the box. For each tube, remove the temporary white cap and fill with WARM water to the fill line indicated on the back of the tube. Replace white cap. SHAKE THOROUGHLY. Remove white cap. Attach hooks to black caps for hanging, and secure the black caps to the top of the tubes. Hang the tubes along the perimeter/property line of the area to be protected, each tube no more than 180 feet apart. Hang the tubes at least 80 feet away from areas where people gather, since mosquitoes will gather near them. If you have woods, heavy vegetation, or a water feature that attracts mosquitoes, hang at least one tube near or within that area, 80 feet away from people. Place an additional tube near that area if outside of the protected zone. Hang the tubes approximately six feet above the ground and no more than 180 feet apart. The ideal place to hang tubes is on a large tree against the trunk on a sturdy branch, or just inside a bush, where they will be shaded and be partially protected from rain. This prevents evaporation and allows some water replenishment from rain. Ensure the water level remains above the WATER LEVEL LOW line for optimal performance. Periodically check tube water level and replenish with water to fill line. If a tube falls or gets knocked off and the contents empty, replace it with a new one. If the tube gets flooded due to heavy rains, dispose of the flooded tube and replace it with a new one."

            "Do you have the dreaded \"black thumb?\" Do you struggle to keep house plants alive, despite your best efforts? Don't give up - there's still hope! A collection of succulents will add colorful and exotic natural beauty to your home or office decor without the tiresome labor that most other house plants require to survive. Succulents come in an endless variety of shapes, colors, textures, and sizes. If you want something different from the usual greenery, you have an entire rainbow of colors to choose from with succulents. If you love the look of flowering plants but can't seem to keep them alive, there are succulents for that! Many species, such as ones in the popular echevaria genus, are shaped like flowers and feature colors just as bright and beautiful as those flowers you've always wanted to flourish in your home. You'll be the envy of your family and friends! Hailed as the easiest house plants to keep due to their extremely minimal care requirements, succulents are taking the world by storm! Their versatility and ease of care make them perfect gifts for everyone from family members and close friends to teachers and co-workers. Succulents are also very popular for weddings as centerpieces and favors for guests. These gorgeous little plants can survive without watering for much longer than other house plants. Watering requirements vary based on the species of succulent and your climate, but it typically varies from once a week to once a month. On top of all that, succulents are very transitional, as they can be kept outdoors during the warm months and brought inside during the colder months."

For decades we relied on grills and other appliances to promote this joyful moment, but let's be honest, every time something seemed to be missing. When we\u2019re barbecuing outside the rest of the family is still locked in the kitchen preparing other dishes. It's not the ideal experience. We wanted more; we wanted to COOK EVERYTHING OUTSIDE! Our products are designed and engineered in the USA with the latest technology and innovation, but we are more than just another outdoor cooking appliance company. Our main focus is on our consumers and designing quality products that yield the best results."

            "The Fiskars stand-up weeder makes it easy to permanently remove invasive plants without sore knees from kneeling, back ache from bending or harsh, costly chemical herbicides that need to be applied multiple times. Just place the head over a weed, step down on the reinforced foot platform, and the four serrated, stainless-steel claws will grab the weed by the root for clean removal. An offset hand reduces wrist strain, a viewing window in the pedal makes claw placement mistake-free, and an easy-eject mechanism clears the head between uses for quick and easy cleanup. Reinforced foot platform is 30% stronger so you can step down confidently to penetrate tough soil.",
            "From the Manufacturer",

The long, sturdy, lightweight aluminum shaft reduces bending, back strain, and kneeling and the four durable stainless steel claws are serrated to grab and remove the weeds - root and all. Easy and fun to use - simply position the tool over the weed, step down on the foot to drive the claws into the ground, pull back on the handle to grab the weed, then lift the tool and eject the pulled weed."

With no batteries or cords needed, the portable repeller is ideal for hunters from the tree stand to the duck blind, as well as on-the-go adventures like fishing, camping, hiking and more. Mosquitoes are no small problem - they can ruin a good time with painful bites, bothersome buzzing, and days of itching afterward. Until now, sprays, lotions, torches, DEET and citronella have been the only options for fighting mosquitoes. We started Thermacell because we wanted a better way to fight mosquitoes. From humble beginnings, our team of entomologists, researchers, and outdoor enthusiasts has over 100 years of combined experience fighting mosquitoes."

            "The first time you try Fiskars PowerGear Super Pruner/Lopper, you\u2019ll be amazed \u2014 but it\u2019s not magic, it\u2019s gears. Fiskars patented gear technology multiplies your leverage to give you up to three times more power on every cut. This means you can power through thick branches that you wouldn\u2019t be able to cut with traditional pruners and loppers. It also means that Fiskars Super Pruner can be smaller and lighter than other loppers, reducing strain on your hands, wrists and muscles when you\u2019re reaching to cut a branch or have a lot of branches to cut. Like many of Fiskars PowerGear tools, our Super Pruner has won the Ease-of-Use Commendation from the Arthritis Foundation. But it\u2019s not just for people with arthritis \u2014 it\u2019s for anyone who appreciates tools that make work easier.",
            "Amazon.com",
            "The small and lightweight Fiskars 15-inch PowerGear anvil lopper provides plenty of leverage and strength for most small shrub and tree pruning jobs around the yard. The tool has a 1-1/4-inch cutting capacity and a unique PowerGear design that maximizes leverage for easier cutting. The handles are made of strong reinforced nylon, and the blade features rust-resistant stainless steel, ensuring a long life of service. Weighing only 13-ounces, the lopper is an ideal choice for the weekend gardener who wants to conserve strength for other pursuits. The unit comes with a limited 10-year warranty."

It is essential that your pump has a working cartridge in order to clear debris and maintain clean water. Without one, water quality will deteriorate Filter cartridges are also great Lay-Z-Spa spares. Keeping a spare filter cartridge handy will save you having to wait for a new one to be delivered when your existing one becomes unusable. You should change your filter cartridge every 3 days during periods of heavy use."

GE's Grow light uses a balanced spectrum with a red: blue ratio inspired by best practices of professional growers. The balanced spectrum allows not only chlorophyll but also other plant pigments to optimize their light harvesting. Compared to typical purple grow lights, the light features high PPF or Photosynthetic Photon Flux to provide more light for photosynthesis and growth. The white light appears more natural to the human eye, so you can appreciate your plant's beauty and spot pests or discolorations to help keep your plants healthy. Use the balanced light spectrum with high light plants like tomatoes and peppers and low light plants like leafy greens and herbs throughout their growing cycle."

            "LET YOUR LAWN BREATHE. Get your lawn in top green shape with the Sun Joe Dethatcher Joe AJ801E 12.6-inch electric scarifier + lawn dethatcher. Powered by a robust 12-amp motor, the Dethatcher Joe rakes a 12.6-inch wide path in a single pass to get your job done fast. Enhancing its raking ability is Airboost technology, which maximizes thatch pickup with spring steel tines that stay sharp longer for reliable performance. Use the 5-position depth control knob to tailor the raking depth from -0.4 in. (10 mm below the soil) to 0.4 in. (10 mm above the soil), depending on your lawn's scarifying or dethatching needs. Scarifying your lawn at regular intervals cuts grass roots and encourages growth for thicker, healthier turf. Thatch is a dense mat of roots, stems and grass clippings that accumulates on lawns over time, blocking the flow of water, oxygen and vital nutrients. It is important to periodically remove thatch in order to keep your lawn green and healthy. While ordinary manual rakes are tiresome to use and not very effective, the electric Dethatcher Joe starts instantly with the push of a button and easily gets the job done without polluting the atmosphere with toxic carbon emissions. No gas, oil or tune-ups make the Sun Joe Dethatcher Joe your green choice for greening your lawn. ETL-approved. 2-year warranty."

She was clearly doomed to love all things Victorian, and ended up studying both English and French nineteenth-century writers in depth.', 'This was a pretty good grounding for launching herself into writing novels set in the nineteenth century. Jane was living in the Chicago suburbs when she began writing the House of Closed Doors series, inspired by a photograph of the long-vanished County Poor Farm in her area.', 'Now back in her native England, Jane lives in an idyllic ancient town in sight of the sea. This location has sparked a new series about an aristocratic family with more secrets than most: The Scott-De Quincy Mysteries.', 'Jane writes for readers who love a series you can\u2019t put down. She blends saga, mystery, adventure, and a touch of romance, set against the background of the real-life issues facing women in the late nineteenth century.', 'Jane is a member of the Alliance of Independent Authors, the Historical Novel Society, Novelists, Inc., and the Society of Authors.']}"

            "The Robelle Supreme Winter Pool Cover is an extra heavy-duty solid winter pool cover. Solid pool covers do not allow water to pass through their material. The Robelle Supreme Winter Pool Cover features an extra heavy-duty 12 x 12 scrim. The extra heavy-duty polyethylene material used for this cover weighs 3.26 oz./yd2. Both the scrim count and material weight are the best indicators of the strength and durability for your pool cover. This is an extra heavy-duty pool cover designed to protect your pool from the winter elements. The Robelle Supreme Winter Pool Cover features a green topside and a black underside. Please order by your pool size, as the overlap goes beyond the pool size listed. This cover includes a four-foot overlap. If you have a very large top rail, please consider a larger pool size. This cover should be able to comfortably float on the pool water without excessive stress. This cover is not meant to be used as a debris cover during the swimming season. This winter pool cover is intended to be used during the off-season. This cover is meant for traditional above ground pools with a traditional top rail. Includes a winch and cable that should be used to secure your pool cover through the grommets around the perimeter of the pool cover. For extra securing, cover clips and cover wrap (both sold separately) are suggested for pool closing. No other method of installation is recommended.."

            "With the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone Bird Feeder you get elegant design and squirrel-resistant function all in one convenient package. The metal cage is adorned with a leafy design that will look at home in any yard. In addition, the metal is finished with a powder coating to enhance the rustic look, while also ensuring rust resistance. To offer defense against squirrels, this feeder boasts multiple great features. First, this feeder\u2019s weight-activated system is calibrated to support the weight of birds but not squirrels. When squirrels try to gain access to the perches, the cage is pulled down, causing the decorative leaves to cover the ports. In addition, the metal cage prevents squirrel chewing and damage. With less competition from squirrels, birds won\u2019t be able to resist the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone Feeder! It features six feeding ports evenly spaced around the reservoir so multiple birds can dine at the same time and you can enjoy a better view. In addition, this feeder has built-in drain holes to prevent water from pooling in the reservoir, so there\u2019s less seed waste. Use the built-in hanging wire to place this attractive feeder anywhere around your yard or patio. Care -Caring for your bird feeder, caring for your hummingbird feeder Keeping your bird feeder clean and full of fresh seed or fresh nectar is very important to the health of visiting birds. It is recommended that you clean your seed bird feeder every two weeks and your hummingbird feeder every week. Clean your bird feeder more often in warmer weather. A mild soap and water solution can be used, however; if the bird feeder needs additional cleaning, you can use diluted vinegar. Be sure to rinse completely. It is not recommended to place any bird feeder in the dishwasher to clean."

Animal control officers also trust and use these live animal traps -- so can you! Use it to trap raccoons, oppossums, skunks, armadillos, groundhogs and other similar-sized animals. Havahart one-door animal cage traps are constructed of sturdy, rust-resistant wire mesh with steel reinforcements and measure approximately 32.2 inches long. Each trap is built to last and galvanized for maximum resistance to rust and corrosion. This trap includes mesh openings that are smaller than competing traps of comparable size, which prevent escapes and stolen bait. A solid, locking door and sensitive trigger ensures quick, secure capture that targets a specific animal size while eliminating undesired catches. Solid handle guards also protect the user while transporting an animal. At the same time, smoothed internal edges protect and prevent the animal from injuring itself. These traps are made in the U.S.A."

While using the Ortho\u00ae Dial N Spray\u00ae Hose End Sprayer, the extended-grip handle and ergonomically designed trigger makes the grip comfortable while the Dial N Spray\u00ae anti-backflow device prevents product from going back into water systems."

        "description": [
            "With TERRO Multi-Surface liquid Ant baits, you have the flexibility to place bait stations almost anywhere around your property. The answer lies in the convenient Multi-Surface application, which allows you to lay the bait stations flat or adhere them to other surfaces. Just use the included adhesive strips to attach the pre-filled, ready-to-use bait stations on walls, under cabinets & a variety of other locations. Not only will this allow you to get the baits as close to the ant activity As possible, but it will also help to keep the stations out of reach of children & pets. In addition, TERRO Multi-Surface liquid Ant baits feature a discreet, two-color design, which seamlessly blends in with the rest of your decor So you won\u2019t even notice it's there. Simply choose the color that matches the location best \u2013 either white or beige \u2013 then apply the adhesive strip to the opposite side. Liquid Ant baits are specifically designed to kill all common household ants. However, since it's a bait, They work slowly to allow worker ants to consume the product & survive long enough to carry the liquid back to the colony. The active ingredient slowly interferes with the ant\u2019s digestive system, & eventually kills it. This ensures that you get rid of the ants you see as well as the ants you don't see."

        "description": [
            "Our TERRO Spider & Insect Traps are ideal for families as the traps are pesticide-free and can be folded up. Folding the trap allows less access to the sticky glue for children and pets, but insects still can find a way inside! This trap can kill the \u201cBig 3\u201d which includes the black widow spider, brown recluse, and hobo spider. Not only is this trap for spiders but also for other insects such as ants, crickets, and cockroaches. To use the trap simply remove the backing from the sticky surface and place in a high traffic area. If you don\u2019t want to use it flat, fold the trap along the marked lines and after removing the backing. Fold the trap to create an open box style. The new design now offers flexibility in creating four separate, smaller glue boards for multiple placements around the home. By adding more edges, efficiency has been proven to have increased by giving insects corridors to travel through to access and get stuck on more of the surface of the glue board. High traffic areas for insects include along baseboards, in corners, and underneath furniture to name a few."

            "The all-purpose design of the X15 Chopping Axe makes felling trees quick and easy. Like every X-Series Hatchet or Axe, the X15 combines perfected weight distribution, advanced blade geometry, an ultra-sharp edge and virtually unbreakable design to maximize your performance. This combination of features allows the blade to bite deeper when chopping. With more blade penetration on each swing, you can chop more wood in less time, with less effort and hand strain.",
            "From the Manufacturer",
            "An unwieldy, oversized axe tends to make its user a little nervous - nothing like the thought of an emergency room visit to suck the fun out of felling and limbing trees, eh? That's why Fiskars has designed this chopping axe (Fiskars Chopping Axe 23.5-Inch #7857) with a shorter, more controllable 23-1/2-inch handle. Easier to swing, lets you land the head exactly where you want it. Plus, the hardened steel blade starts out sharp, stubbornly holds its edge, and chews quickly through flinty heartwood with help from the friction-reducing non-stick coating. Better still, Fiskars cures the dangerous problem of loosening axe heads with an insert-molded design locks the blade in place so it won't ever unhitch itself from the durable, weatherproof handle. Includes a sturdy sheath for safe storage and transportation. And the Fiskars lifetime warranty of performance excellence."

The professional-style saw folds for safe transportation and easy storage. The unit's razor-toothed curved-blade design cuts faster and cleaner than conventional saws for increased plant health and less pruning effort. The self-cleaning chrome blade is both corrosion-resistant and replaceable. Additionally, the razor teeth are three-sided for increased efficiency and impulse-hardened for exceptional durability and strength. The co-molded ergonomic handle is designed for added comfort and easy all-day use, making this an ideal choice for personal or professional use. Each tooth is triple ground providing three multi-faceted angles to maximize cutting efficiency and wood removal. Focused Impulse hardening process on blade teeth maintains tooth sharpness after multiple cuts without adding brittleness to overall blade. Hard chrome layer is added to the blade which reduces friction during the cut for less effort and provides a rust preventative layer for longer life. Limited lifetime warranty",

His best-known work, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, has eaten its way into the hearts of literally millions of children all over the world and has been translated into more than 62 languages and sold over 41 million copies. Since the Caterpillar was published in 1969, Eric Carle has illustrated more than 70 books, many best sellers, most of which he also wrote.', 'Carle says: \"With many of my books I attempt to bridge the gap between the home and school. To me home represents, or should represent; warmth, security, toys, holding hands, being held. School is a strange and new place for a child. Will it be a happy place? There are new people, a teacher, classmates - will they be friendly? I believe the passage from home to school is the second biggest trauma of childhood; the first is, of course, being born. Indeed, in both cases we leave a place of warmth and protection for one that is unknown. The unknown often brings fear with it. In my books I try to counteract this fear, to replace it with a positive message. I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun.\"', 'Eric Carle has two grown-up children, a son and a daughter. He divides his time between the Florida Keys and the hills of North Carolina.', 'For more information about Eric Carle and his books please visit:', 'The Official Eric Carle web site: http://www.eric-carle.com', \"Eric Carle's Blog: http://www.ericcarleblog.blogspot.com\", 'The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art: http://www.carlemuseum.org', 'The World of Eric Carle Amazon UK page: https://www.amazon.co.uk/l/1658013031']}"

            "Scotts\u00ae Turf Builder\u00ae Triple Action provides three benefits in one bag. This 3-in-1 formula kills and prevents listed weeds, all while feeding and strengthening your lawn. It kills listed broadleaf weeds like dandelion and clover, and prevents crabgrass for up to 4 months. It also prevents other listed grassy weeds, including barnyardgrass, fall panicum, foxtail, and annual bluegrass. Scotts\u00ae Turf Builder\u00ae Triple Action is for use on Kentucky Bluegrass, Perennial Ryegrass, Tall Fescue, Fine Fescue, Bermudagrass, Bahiagrass, and Centipedegrass. Apply in the spring before crabgrass appears or after dandelions sprout in your yard. Make sure your grass is wet from dew or sprinkling before applying, as this helps particles adhere to weed leaves to produce the best results. We recommend using a Scotts\u00ae spreader to apply this product. For Scotts\u00ae broadcast/rotary spreaders, use a setting of 4 \u00bd. For Scotts\u00ae drop spreaders, use a setting of 7 \u00be. For Scotts\u00ae Wizz\u00ae, use a setting of 5. After 24 hours, water the lawn to wash particles onto the soil to prevent the germination of crabgrass. One 50 lb. bag of Scotts\u00ae Turf Builder\u00ae Triple Action covers 10,000 sq. ft."

            "TERRO Outdoor Liquid Ant Baits are ideal for large ant infestations. It attracts and kills all common household ants including Argentine ants, ghost ants, cornfield ants, pavement ants, acrobat ants, white footed ants, little black ants, odorous house ants and other sweet eating ants. To attract and kill ants, simply place the pre-filled, ready-to-use liquid bait stations outdoors in areas where ants are observed and, if desired, secure baits with the stakes provided. The bait stations can also be placed on decks, or in garages or basements without using the stakes. Ants typically follow defined trails from the nest to food or water. Placing the outdoor ant baits close to these trails will improve control. The patented outdoor ant baits prevent the liquid bait from drying out, providing the ants with a continuous supply of food, day and night."

            "Outsmart the mouse in your house and reclaim your space once and for all. Tomcat\u00ae Mouse Killer Child Resistant, Disposable Station is a bait station pre-filled with one poison block that kills up to 12 mice (based on no-choice laboratory testing). Designed for mice, this bait station is resistant to tampering by children. It also features a clear lid for easy monitoring, so you will never have to wonder if the bait has been consumed. Tomcat\u00ae Mouse Killer Child Resistant, Disposable Station is for indoor use only, but can be used in a variety of locations within your home. Place in an area where rodent activity has been noticed, such as basements, garages, behind appliances, or inside cabinets. After feeding on the bait, the mouse will likely go back into hiding then die elsewhere within a few days. Keep pre-loaded bait stations out until rodent activity comes to an end, then dispose in the trash. This package of Tomcat\u00ae Mouse Killer Child Resistant, Disposable Station includes 4 pre-filled, ready-to-use bait stations."

            "The Perky-Pet Small Panorama Wild Bird Feeder is sure to attract many birds to your backyard, including cardinals, titmice, nuthatches and more. The innovative design of this feeder allows the seed to dispense into the tray and stops dispensing once the tray is full. Simply fill with sunflower seed, mixed seed, or any other kind of bird seed. Then, as the birds dine from the circular perch, the seed is replenished into the tray so it remains consistently full. This feeder also features the Sure-Lock cap system, an exclusive squirrel-resistant feature, which ensures the lid stays put and so squirrels have a difficult time gaining access to the seed. Use the built-in hanging cable to place this feeder anywhere around your yard. The Small Panorama holds 2 lb of seed and features a rustic brown finish to blend with your outdoor d\u00e9cor. Remember to clean your wild bird feeders every two weeks with a mild soap and water solution."

            "Enjoy the distinct pecan smoke flavor from Western Premium BBQ Products. Take your cookout to the next level with Western Premium BBQ Products Pecan BBQ Smoking Chips. They are made from real heat-treated pecan wood to deliver a robust flavor to every meal. Pecan smoke can give your smoked meats a bold new layer of flavor. Smoking chips are a great way to add depth to the taste of your next barbequed meal. Kudos to you, fellow grill master. You got this far by adding some wood smoking chips to your grill to infuse your meats with a pecan flavor. Western Premium BBQ Products Pecan BBQ Smoking Chips are easy to use and they work on gas grills, charcoal grills, and electric smokers. The next time you\u2019re thinking of making smoked meat for the family, add some Western Premium BBQ Products Pecan BBQ Smoking Chips to the grilling process. Be the cookout hero your friends and family deserve! If you\u2019re using wood chips for smoking your meats on a gas or charcoal grill, place dry wood chips in a foil pack or a smoke box and place them over the heat. Let the pecan chips start smoking, and then move them to one side of your grill. Place your meat on the grill and close the lid. Cook to time or temperature you normally would, keeping the lid closed as much as possible. If you\u2019re using wood smoking chips in a charcoal grill, load your grill with lump charcoal. Light the charcoal using your preferred method; however, we would recommend you avoid using lighter fluid, so your meat retains the natural pecan smoke flavor. Several minutes prior to cooking, fill a smoker tray or a foil pouch with one to two handfuls of chips. Place the tray or pouch on the hottest part of the grill surface until it begins to smoke. Once the chips have begun smoking, move them with tongs to make room for your future meal. Add your meat to the grill, close the lid, and smoke until you achieve that great pecan smoke flavor."

            "Seed Saver Technology",
            "Openings in the bottom section of the metal mesh shroud align with the seed tray, providing birds access to the food. When a squirrel climbs onto the feeder, its weight automatically forces the shroud down, closing access to the seed. Squirrels and some large birds are blocked from accessing the seed, but are not harmed in any way.",
            "Negative Grip Tube",

            "Seed Ventilation System",
            "Traditional transparent seed tube designs trap solar energy and block the escape of hot, moist air. The seed ventilation system lets hot and humid air escape through vents at the top  of the feeder as fresh air enters the seed ports and openings on the bottom of the seed tube. Birdseed remains fresher and attracts more birds.",

Position the feeder by your deck, in a nearby tree, or over a favorite window for those great close-up views. The bird feeder hangs easily with the use of wall brackets, branch hooks, or extension hooks.",
            "Be sure to allow for at least 16 inches (40 cm) of clearance around the feeder. This clearance will prevent a squirrel from reaching over from a nearby foothold to access the seed without placing its weight on the feeder. Forcing the squirrel to climb all the way onto the feeder triggers the closing mechanism, preventing access.",

            "The Hydrotools collection of weighted swimming pool vacuum heads is designed to give you a deep and efficient clean for all types of pools. With an extra-large surface area for cleaning, this vac head is sure to pick up dirt and debris quickly and effectively. Strategically positioned brush bristles help further loosen and capture dirt and debris, increasing your vacuuming performance and reducing the amount of time you need to spend cleaning. integrated weighting systems ensure that the vacuum sinks quickly to the bottom of your pool and stays submerged, creating the optimal environment for strong suction of dirt, bugs, leaves, dust, and other common debris. The vacuum head is compatible with virtually all hoses, thanks to our built in Universal Hose Connector which has two ports to fit both 1-1/4 and 1-1/2 inch hose. Our double reinforced molded handles have adaptable EZ clip attachment points, making them compatible with practically all standard sized extension poles and telescopic poles / telepoles. The vacuum head is built to last with double reinforced industrial-grade material that is UV, weather, and corrosion resistant. This Hydrotools Vacuum Head is designed and tested in our New York headquarters and is suitable for a wide range of environments including home pools, commercial pools, above ground and inground pools, resorts, spas, and more. With Hydrotools' professional customer service and a 1 year guarantee against manufacturing defects, you can trust in the quality of Hydrotools vac heads. For even better results, use this vacuum head with Hydrotools telescopic poles (example item 8351).",

            "EasyFlex No-Dig Landscape Edging is a durable and decorative landscaping solution to beautifully finish any gardening project. Designed for quick and easy installation, no digging is required to use EasyFlex No-Dig Landscape Edging. The 100 ft. edging kit includes all you need to create a clean line between grass and landscaping. Simply clear the area of loose dirt and debris, align the edging to your desired area, and use a rubber mallet to pound the anchoring stakes (included) into the ground. Not every project is the same, so we made sure EasyFlex garden edging is easy to handle and cut to the length you need. Give your planting beds, sidewalks, and patios a professionally finished look with No-Dig plastic lawn edging. Flexible enough to create tight circles around trees, the patented No-Dig L-shape design eliminates damage from digging into tree and plant roots. Use the recycled plastic No-Dig Edging with weed fabric to help prevent unwanted grass and weeds growing into flower beds. The spikes pierce through weed fabric easily and help secure the barrier. The 1.5 inch high EasyFlex No-Dig Landscape Edging is strong enough to retain bedding materials including pine needles, lava stone, river rock, cedar, plastic, wood mulch, and more. Kit contains (1) 100' coil of edging, (30) 8-inch anchoring spikes, and (5) connectors."

            "Product Description",
            "There's so much to think about with a new baby and ensuring correct room temperature is maintained is an important part of safe and comfortable sleep. Health professionals recommend that the temperature of the baby's sleeping environment should ideally be maintained between 16 to 20 degrees centigrade. The Gro-egg is a unique colour-changing nursery thermometer that provides safety reassurance at a glance, reminding you to change the baby's bedding, clothing or adjust the room temperature if required -making it a nursery essential for new parents. If parents are using the Grobag baby sleep bag, the Gro-egg is the perfect partner, helping to highlight which tog to use. The Gro-egg also works as a gentle night light, offering enough light to check on your baby in a darkened room.",
            "From the Manufacturer",
            "The Gro-egg color changing digital room thermometer is another clever innovation from the people who brought you grobag baby sleeping bags. Room temperature is vital in creating a safe sleeping environment for your baby and should be maintained at 61-67\u00b0F to help reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The Gro-egg glows yellow if the room temperature is within recommended guidelines (61-67\u00b0F). If the room temperature is outside this range, the Gro-egg acts as a visual reminder for you to take action to cool or heat the room, or to adjust the baby's bedding or clothing. Every baby's home should have a Gro-egg room thermometer and it is ideal for use with grobag baby sleeping bags to help you to monitor the temperature of the room where your baby is sleeping."

            "Our Sansevieria Superba is a stunning, variegated succulent plant featured in an ornamental plastic plant pot with a built-in draining tray. This tall plant is known by numerous common names, including snake plant, Mother-In-Law's Tongue, Devil\u2019s Tongue, bowstring hemp, and sword plant. Sansevieria succulents are among the most popular live houseplants available, having widespread appeal for their attractive features and low maintenance requirements. The wavy, pointed leaves of this variety feature horizontal patterns of green-silver variegation and stripes of golden-yellow along the edges, offering natural beauty with minimal effort. Growing upright from a basal rosette, this hardy, herbaceous evergreen forms dense strands that spread through its thick, creeping rhizome. Create a dynamic home d\u00e9cor display by arranging your decorative planter with accessories, various species of Sansevieria, and other houseplants to highlight contrasting textures and colors [e.g. Sansevieria trifasciata zeylanica, Sansevieria trifasciata Laurentii, Sansevieria trifasciata Prain, Sansevieria trifasciata Bantel, philodendron, Dieffenbachia, fittonia plant, ZZ plant, pothos plant]. Snake plants can thrive as indoor or outdoor plants due to their tolerance of moderate to bright light, and are best kept in a partially shaded area out of direct sunlight. Show off your snake plant\u2019s gorgeous features by displaying it on a front porch or patio alongside companion plants, such as a staghorn fern or croton plant. Perfect for plant owners of any skill, Sansevieria plants are extremely drought-tolerant and almost impossible to kill, only requiring water about once every other week. Allow the soil to dry between waterings to prevent root rot. Keep your plant thriving with a loose, well-draining potting soil and a small amount of plant food once per month during the growing season [late spring through summer]. Ideal temperature for this species ranges from 70\u00b0F to 90\u00b0F, not dropping below 50\u00b0F."

        "description": [
            "GRILLTEX Grill Mats are designed to shield decks, patios, garage floors and other surfaces from damage caused by drips and spills around your outdoor grill. The 36 x 50 inch rectangular mat is perfect for pellet or wood smokers, gas grills, turkey fryers, and more. The pebbled top texture provides an attractive look and a protective barrier from grease, oils, sauces and other messes. The unique front drip zone is a lip that extends past the grill front to catch drips, spills, or splatter in the area that needs it most. Protecting your wood or composite wood decking is a smart move, especially when frying turkeys for Thanksgiving, tailgates or holiday parties. GRILLTEX mats protect your patio from grease splatter, juice drips, and dropped food. The shallow pebbled texture is easy to clean. Just wipe with a paper towel or spray with a hose. For more stubborn messes, use a household cleaner. The black patio mats are 0.11 inch thick and have a mini pyramid texture on the underside. Each GRILLTEX mat contains an antifungal and antimicrobial agent that protects the mat from deterioration due to fungus and bacteria. The mats are tested to perform up to 500-degrees F and can be used under most cookers and grills with a heat source that sits approximately 6 inches above the mat. The mat is not intended to be used as a heat shield, or come into contact with direct flame or heat sources. If left on the mat, embers and coals can burn a hole through the plastic matting. To assure the best fit for your grill, smoker or turkey fryer, measure the width and depth of your cooker and select the mat size that allows a minimum of 2-3 inches of coverage around the perimeter of your grill. GRILLTEX Grill Mats are durable and heavy duty, yet roll easily for handling and storage.."

            "WORX WG509 TRIVAC 12 Amp 3-In-1 Electric Blower/Mulcher/Vacuum with Multi-Stage All Metal Mulching System,BlackThe Worx 350 cfm \u2013 12A Electric TRIVAC Blower/Vac is your 3-in-1 complete leaf and debris clearing system. Blow the leaves into a pile, flip the switch and suck them up and mulch them into the collection bag, and dump it for compost or collection. It takes a chore that often lasts all afternoon and makes it go much quicker. It takes 18 bags worth of leaves and chops it down into 1 with its powerful two-stage metal impeller and shredder blades. If a leaf blower is better than a rake, the TRIVAC is better than a regular ol\u2019 leaf blower. You don\u2019t even need to switch out tubes to change between functions. You just flip a switch. And that tube is angled so you can get under patio furniture and the deck without having to squat or get on your hands and knees. And even though this machine blows out air between 80 and 210 mph, it weighs less than 10 lbs and has been engineered to be operated with just one hand. That means almost anyone can use it to clean up the yard or blow out the driveway. The collection bag technically holds 1.2 Bushels of yard waste, but again, with the 18:1 mulcher, that\u2019s going to be 18x more leaves than if you were raking or blowing the traditional way. Stop making yard work such a chore, and grab yourself a TRIVAC 3-in-1 Blowing, Vacuuming & Mulching System.WORX WA4054.2 LeafPro Universal Leaf Collection System for All Major Blower/Vac BrandsWhat used to take all day can now be completed in a fraction of the time with the Worx LEAFPRO Universal Leaf Collection System. Hook it up to pretty much any leaf blower/vac on the market and suck up all the leaves on your lawn. You\u2019ll have to stop to empty it far less than if you\u2019re just using the bag that came with the blower/vac. And if your blower/vac has mulching capabilities, you can fit an entire large yard worth of leaves into one waste container and only empty it once when you\u2019re done. That\u2019s why we call it a no-touch high-capacity leaf collection system. The LEAFPRO is durable, with a hood made of tear-resistant material, a professional-quality 8-foot hose, and a multi-fit adapter that forms a tight seal with the output valve of 90% of the blower/vacs out there. It works with Black & Decker, Husqvarna, Poulan, Craftsman, Ryobi, Toro, Murray, and many more. And while it fits most of our Worx blower/vacs, this model is not compatible with the TURBINE Fusion. Check out the WA4057 model for use with that blower/mulcher/vac. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that you needed a rake and an entire Saturday to clear a large lawn. With the LEAFPRO hooked up to your trusty blower/vac, you\u2019ll be back on the couch before you know it."

TERRO Ant Killer Plus is packaged in a resealable shaker bag to allow for easy application. Simply open the top, grab the handle located at the bottom of the bag, and start spreading the granules. There\u2019s no need to use a spreader! To apply as a perimeter treatment, create a 3 to 10 foot band of granules along your foundation. To treat ant hills (except fire ants), apply 1 to 2 teaspoons on granules over and around the ant hill. Be sure to water the granules lightly immediately following application. To control fire ants, apply \u00bd cup of granules over, and 2 feet around each mound. After apply, gently water the product with a minimum of a gallon of water to each mound area. Avoid using a high-pressure hose, which could disturb the ants and cause migration."

            "\"Clorox\u00ae Pool&Spa\u2122 pH Up raises low pH in your pool so you can maintain a beautiful, swim-ready pool. The granulated formula dissolves fast, and the easy pour application bag makes raising your pH simple, and fast. Low pH in your pool can cause red, irritated eyes and expensive corrosion damage to your pool equipment. Use this pH increaser as needed to achieve a suitable range of 7.2 to 7.6 to keep your water swim-ready and clear. Intended for use in both traditional chlorine and salt chlorine pools. Test and balance your pool weekly with the Clorox Pool app to maintain clear water, longer lasting equipment, and comfortable swimming. Maintaining proper pH of 7.2 to 7.6 is both important and easy. Important, because if pH is too high, chlorine cannot effectively sanitize and disinfect your water and water will irritate your skin and eyes when you swim. If pH is too low, corrosion can occur and the pool water will irritate your skin. \""

The Coleman\u00ae SaluSpa\u00ae AirJet\u2122 provides a soothing massage experience for up to 4 people, while still being quick and easy to set up. Simply attach the pump and watch as it inflates. Soothing Massage System: The AirJet system features 140 jets which release bubbles from the bottom of the spa to create a warm, bubbling hot tub environment. These soothing bubbles will help you relax and unwind right from the comfort of your home. Durable Construction: This spa\u2019s inflatable walls and internal beams are made of durable, puncture-resistant, DuraPlus\u2122 material which prevents damage. This type of internal construction prevents stretching and expansion, allowing the spa to retain the same shape no matter how many times it's inflated and deflated. The included Freeze Shield\u2122 automatic heating function prevents inner components from freezing during colder temperatures ensuring you can enjoy your spa year after year. Contents: Equipped with a pump that quickly inflates the spa, heats it up, runs filtration and controls the massage system, this spa is both easy and convenient. The pump can easily be reached from inside the spa and features cup holders for drinks and snacks. Also included is a ChemConnect\u2122 dispenser that maintains clean, healthy water by evenly dispersing the proper amount of chlorine. To top it all off, this Coleman spa comes with a reinforced cover that locks in heat while not in use, as well as keeping dust and debris from collecting on the water."

            "Be ready for anything with DuroMax\u2019s XP12000EH, 12,000-watt Dual Fuel portable generator. Nicknamed the \"BEAST\", this unit provides the power normally found in home standby units but in a portable package. Offering power and versatility, the XP12000EH is perfect for powering your home\u2019s essential appliances and even central A/C through any power outage, storm, or emergency event. You can also easily transport this unit to the job or camp site. This Dual Fuel generator runs on either gasoline or propane, which provides the freedom and flexibility of fuel choice. While gasoline is a tried and true fuel option, liquid propane lasts longer, costs less, has a longer storage life and won\u2019t gum up or damage the carburetor. The XP12000EH features a user-friendly, keyed electric start, and is also equipped with an optional recoil start. This powerhouse generator is powered by a 457cc, DuroMax OHV Engine that feeds the fully loaded power panel allowing the user to pull up to the maximum 12, 000 watts of power. The panel includes two 120V/20AMP outlets, one 120v/30AMP twist lock outlet, a 120/240V 30AMP outlet, and a 50-amp heavy duty outlet to power the most demanding needs. The panel also features a volt meter, circuit breakers, low oil indicator, idle control, and DuroMax\u2019s unique MX2 switch, which doubles your 120-volt amperage for heavy loads. With it you can get maximum power from each 120-volt receptacle and have the option of operating at both 120 and 240 volts simultaneously. The units heavy-duty all-metal frame has fully-isolated motor mounts, and an oversized noise reducing muffler with a built-in spark arrestor allowing for smooth and quiet operation. The XP12000EH is easy to transport over any terrain with the included handle kit and runs on rugged and durable solid-fill tires. Like all DuroMax generators, this unit is built with all copper windings, that will last for years, and is covered by a 3-year factory ."

This package includes 12 child-resistant roach killing bait stations and 1 syringe of roach killing gel. How Combat Max Defense System Brand Roach Killing Bait Works: 1. Roaches enter the bait station and eat the bait. 2. Roaches take the bait back to the nest. 3. Roaches share the bait, killing other roaches and destroying the nest. The gel attracts roaches in search of food and water to the bait. Roaches ingest the bait and return to die in their nest."

            "Spa Choice Sanitizing Granules are designed to dissolve quickly and completely. Chlorine granules provide a steady source of available chlorine to spa water to control algae growth, kill bacteria and destroy organic contaminants. Spa choice chlorine granules are stabilized to protect against ultraviolet radiation from the sun, increasing the life of your chlorine. This product is designed to dissolve quickly and completely providing a steady source of available chlorine to control the growth of algae, kill bacteria and destroy organic contaminants. DIRECTIONS FOR APPLICATION: Broadcast the product evenly over a wide area in the deepest part of the spa with water circulating. DIRECTIONS FOR SPA AND HOT TUB USE: Each level teaspoon (0.17 ounces) of this product will provide approximately 1.4 ppm available chlorine in 500 gallons of water. Using an appropriate test kit, test and adjust the water to the following values: pH 7.2-7.8, total alkalinity 60-100 ppm, calcium hardness 200 ppm minimum. Maintain these conditions for proper spa and hot tub operation by frequent testing with a test kit. Do not allow cyanuric acid level to exceed 150 ppm. It is recommended that spas and hot tubs be drained every 30-90 days. More often under heavy use. Consult manufacturer\u2019s recommendations concerning the compatibility of chlorine sanitizers with their equipment. Some oils, lotions, fragrances and cleaners may cause foaming or cloudy water and may react with chlorine sanitizers to reduce their efficacy. DIRECTIONS FOR START-UP (FRESHLY FILLED) 1.

In addition, brominating tabs kill bacteria and make your spa water less pH sensitive. Bromine is the most common method of sanitizing spas, available in multiple sizes. Make sure you use bromine tabs in your spa regularly. An unkept spa can quickly grow harmful bacteria from a wet, hot environment. Test your spa water frequently to maintain a pH balance of 7.2-7.6 and 3-6 ppm of bromine. Drain, clean and refill your spa every 90 days."

            "This chime plays the familiar tones heard in the opening measures of Amazing Grace, one of America\u2019s best loved hymns. The lyrics were written by Englishman John Newton in the late 18th century. As a young man on board a merchant ship, Newton underwent a spiritual awakening while caught in a deadly storm at sea. This was the beginning of a journey that would lead the one-time slave trader to become a vocal abolitionist, and transform a man without conviction into one of unshakable faith. It has played an important role in drug and alcohol recovery, the Civil War, the Civil Rights Movement and 9/11. Newton\u2019s message of hope and redemption from over 200 years ago resonates with the same power today in our Amazing Grace Chime. \u2018Tis grace has brought me safe thus far, And grace will lead me home. - John Newton Over 30 years ago, Grammy award-winning musician and instrument designer Garry Kvistad created the first Woodstock Chime from an aluminum lawn chair he found in a landfill. Fascinated by the Scale of Olympos, a 7th century pentatonic scale that can\u2019t be played on a modern piano, Garry cut and tuned the lawn chair tubes to the exact frequency of the ancient scale. The resulting Chimes of Olympos was the first Woodstock Chime and is still one of our best selling, musically-tuned windchimes. Garry and his wife Diane founded Woodstock Chimes in 1979 and still develop the chimes today. It remains a family-owned business in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley."

            "Keep your succulent plants happy and fed with Miracle-Gro\u00ae Succulent Plant Food. This easy-to-use plant food gets to work as soon as it's applied, feeding instantly. Simply apply directly to soil and water as normal. We recommend applying 2 pumps for small pots and 5 pumps for large pots (over 6\" diameter). Make sure to rinse from leaves as you water. For best results, feed your succulents every two weeks. In addition to feeding, other factors that contribute to growing healthy succulents include using a lightweight, well-draining soil and providing them with the right amount of light. A common misconception is that all succulents like hot temperatures. Some do, but others need a bit of protection from afternoon sun. Do some research on the varieties you're growing to ensure you place them in the right spot. In general, purple, red, and orange-leaved varieties grow best and most colorfully in full sun. Miracle-Gro\u00ae Succulent Plant Food is great to use on all succulents, including cacti, jade, aloe vera, zebra plant, moonstones, prickly pear, and more."

            "Changing the game of lawn care, one yard at a time, the GT Revolution is 3 lawn manicuring tools in one. Converts almost instantly from a trimmer, to an in-line wheeled edger, to a mini-mower, so you get a professional-looking lawn that\u2019s easier to maintain and costs less time and money. This is so much more than a weed-eater. It\u2019s a Revolution. At less than 6 lbs, and with a telescoping shaft, 7 handle, and 6 rotating head positions, almost anyone can comfortably use the Revolution. The shaft is a full foot longer than the original GT, and the grips are ergonomically designed to give the user a firm handle on each of the three functions. And when you want to switch from trimmer to edger or mini-mower, it\u2019s just a push of a button and a turn of the head. No tools needed. It\u2019s powerful, too! Spinning at 7600 revs/min and running on the same 20V 4.0 Ah Powershare battery that powers our chainsaws, the GT makes nice, clean cuts. The patented Command Feed system gives you fresh line whenever you need it\u2014no bumping or auto-feed. With an extra spool holder right on the handle, if you do run out of line in the field, you can just pop in your extra spool without a trip back to the shed."

            "The GreenWorks products that you purchase have a ZERO carbon footprint. We'll say that again - our entire product line will never release an ounce of carbon emission into the air. 4 Year Warranty - Double The Industry Standard. When looking for lawn tools, we know you're thinking about quality. You're looking for something that will get the job done and get you back to your weekend. That's why GreenWorks backs every tool with a full four-year warranty - we know our products will perform at the highest level and always be reliable. GreenWorks high quality products are manufactured to last. That's why we back every product with a warranty that's twice the industry standard. We'll provide all the power you need without polluting the air or forcing you to keep hauling your gas can to the nearest station (especially in the middle of a mow). No more tune-ups or maintenance. No more emissions. Fifty-four million Americans mow their lawns every weekend, according to the EPA, using 800 million gallons of gas each year. Along the way, homeowners spill more than 17 million gallons of gas while refueling. That's equivalent to the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster. It's time to move beyond clumsy, harmful gas-powered mowers. It's time for GreenWorks to be your lawn tools for life."

Black Flag Fly Stick attracts and traps houseflies and other flying pests indoors or outdoors anywhere flying insects are a nuisance. Simply add honey or syrup to attract them to the stick \u2013 once they land, they never leave. Hang in any room of the house; near your porch, patio or garden; around recreational areas; near garbage containers; and inside barns, kennels and stables. Replace every 3 months or when the stick is full. Just remove, wrap in newspaper and dispose of in trash. For best results, hang vertically with all sides of the stick exposed, near the center of the area where you wish to control flying insect problems. Add 1 tsp of honey or syrup to the bottom plastic cup."

Additionally, they require only a moderate amount of light and only need watering about once a week, making them the lowest-maintenance plants available!",
            "What separates these unique plants from other plants are their leaves, which have adapted to absorb water and nutrients from the air. This allows air plants to thrive when they are suspended in the air or grown atop driftwood and rocks. Air plants are perfect for terrariums, cages, and glass containers with holes or gaps that allow for plenty of air flow. There are a myriad of other creative ways to display air plants; the possibilities are limited only by your imagination! Air plants look especially beautiful when set atop river stones, natural-colored gravel, or driftwood.",
            "Air plants make excellent gifts for house-warming or other occasions. They are also work wonderfully as desktop decorations for your office or home desk.",
            "We recommend keeping air plants in an area where they receive a moderate amount of light. Indirect sunlight and artificial home/office lighting are appropriate for these plants. It's generally safe to keep air plants in direct sunlight for a short period of time each day, but we recommend misting them with water every 2 hours or so to keep them from drying out. The optimal way to water air plants is to soak them in water for 2 hours once per week. If you find the leaves of your air plants are becoming soft or pale in color, this means the plant is too dry, and you should try misting or watering them more often.",
            "Air plants come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, though most species primarily feature green leaves. Many of our air plants also exhibit stunning pink blooms.",
            "Each air plant ranges from 2 to 5 inches in size. The plants you receive may or may not already have blooms."

            "The safest way to keep your trees looking sharp, the Worx 10\u201d \u2013 8A Electric Pole Saw is a well-balanced chainsaw that you can easily hoist in the air. Or, take off the pole and use it for regular chainsaw projects down on the ground. It\u2019s got a lot of bite for a 10\u201d bar, and plenty of modern features that make it easy to use. With a 28 ft/s chain speed and advanced auto lubrication and tensioning systems, you\u2019ll always have a powerful saw at your disposal. The oil level window lets you know when you\u2019ll need to refill. And the auto tension knob will never let you turn too far to potentially damage the chain. This ergonomically engineered pole saw features a handle that rotates 180\u00b0 so you can turn the whole saw on its side without having to turn your body. The pole attaches and detaches easily. The handguard protects you from falling debris. And an off/on switch on the bottom of the pole lets you start or stop the saw without bringing it up and down repeatedly. This is an electric chainsaw, so you don\u2019t have to worry about all the downsides of gas-powered tools: This saw will be less expensive to run and maintain, cleaner for both you and the environment, and much quieter. This is 2 saws for the price of one. Plus, it\u2019s the safer way to trim your branches."

            "With the Perky-Pet Pinch-Waist Glass Hummingbird Feeder, entertaining hummingbirds in your backyard has never been easier. It\u2019s the classic design that you know and love with a few great updates, including a new and improved wide-mouth bottle and bird-preferred U-shaped perches. Meanwhile, the attention-catching color and 8 oz nectar capacity are irresistible to hummers. For your convenience, this feeder disassembles completely for effortless cleaning. Remove the ant moat, base and bottle with ease \u2013 even the built-in bee guards come apart! In addition, the wide-mouth design makes it easy to access hard-to-reach spots of the bottle, while also allowing for mess-free filling. The Perky-Pet Pinch-Waist Glass Hummingbird Feeder also features convenient insect defenses. The bee guards keep bees at bay, while hummingbirds can still easily access the nectar. To keep ants away, fill the top of the lid with water to create a barrier that prevents them from crawling down to the ports."

            "Bright and Clear from Leisure Time is specially designed for hot water application. Spa water becomes cloudy because millions of small, suspended particles accumulate in the water and are too small to be filtered out. By using Bright and Clear hot tub cleaner, the small particles combine to form larger particles that can be trapped by the filter to improve water clarity. Using spa cleaning chemicals has never been easier with Leisure Time spa supplies. This staple hot tub chemical utilizes polymer action suspend and filter particles. Allow spa to run for several minutes after use before entering. About the Brand: Leisure Time was developed for use in spas, hot tubs, and jacuzzies. Our water care products are both economical and powerful enough for the toughest jobs. Within Leisure Time\u2019s wide selection of products, we offer everything from algaecides and deposit control formulas to non-chlorine shock treatments, powerful surface cleaners, clarifiers, enzyme-based cleaners, and more.

The baits are easy to use - simply place the stakes in outdoor areas where ants have been observed, break the tab open, and let the bait work its magic. A see through bait monitor helps you keep track of when it\u2019s time to replace. The stakes are weatherproof, offering protection through all elements."

The welded steel construction is far more durable than wood and won\u2019t flex like fiberglass. A sharpened shovel blade cuts dense soil and thick roots easily, and a foot platform helps maximize force to break up hardened soil clods. The powder-coated steel resists rust and offers easy cleaning.

You can adjust the length of Triflora\u2019s ropes and slide them anywhere along the metal rod to customize the position of each hanging pot. Triflora's pots can hold standard 3-inch (7.6 cm) diameter pots (so there\u2019s no need for re-potting). Max weight capacity of 15lbs, (6.8kg). Triflora can also be used outdoors. Need some drainage? Easily drill a small hole into the bottom of each pot."

            "Looking to add a bit of greenery to your home or garden decor? Allow American Plant Exchange to introduce you to the lovely Monstera Deliciosa Plant. The plants are known for their vibrant, waxy, large, dark green leaves that have natural holes in them. Also known as Split Leaf Philodendron Plant, the leaves of the plant can be 3' long and 2' wide. Producing edible fruits called cerimans or monsteras, this indoor plant prefers bright to medium indirect light and temperatures between 68-86\u00b0 F. The plants can grow up to 10-15' tall and 8\u2019 wide indoors. Keeping live plants around your home has various health benefits, including purified air for breathing and improved mood levels.",
            "Shipping and handling can be very tough on live plants, so please be sure to open and check your plant right away. Our team waters each plant before it is shipped and wrapped, so it may not need to be watered right away. We strongly recommend allowing 3-4 weeks for your plant to acclimate to its new home before re-potting it.",
            "American Plant Exchange is a 35-year-old Florida-based family nursery that supports women in our community in a mutually beneficial work release skill development program."

            "Spa 56 Granular Chlorine is a spa and hot tub sanitizer that can be used on a regular maintenance basis or as a strong shock. Made with sodium di-chlor that features a strong 56% pure chlorine, this spa treatment comes in a granular format that does not need to be pre-dissolved and does not add unwanted calcium or leave residue. Leisure Time Spa 56 also destroys foreign organic material that comes from human use, making it a high-quality chlorine source for spas and hot tubs. Broadcast directly into spa water with jets running. Maintain free chlorine levels between 2-3 ppm. Wait 5 minutes after adding to soak. Use caution and follow instructions when handling spa chlorine. Chlorine works best if pH and Alkalinity are balanced in spa water.

            "Use Jobe\u2019s Organics Palm granular fertilizer with Biozome on all palm trees and plants. The Jobe\u2019s Biozome advantage for organic gardening: improves the long-term soil quality of your garden, increases root mass, promotes plant growth and helps your garden against disease, drought and other unfavorable conditions within a growing season. Delivers long-term benefits without chemicals. Jobe\u2019s Biozome is a unique and proprietary blend of beneficial microorganisms Archaea, Mycorrhizal fungi and healthy bacteria. Archaea, a recently identified microorganism found in some of the planet\u2019s most extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. In garden applications, scientists have discovered that these microbes actually clean the soil, returning it to a healthier, more natural state. Jobe\u2019s Biozome contains a proprietary species of Archaea that quickly breaks down complex hydrocarbons and minerals into basic nutrients and trace elements that plants readily absorb. Mycorrhizal fungi expands the surface-absorbing area of the roots by 100 to 1,000 times, sending out filaments that act as extensions of the plant\u2019s root system, helping plants absorb more water and nutrients. In return, the fungi receive essential sugars and other compounds from the plant roots, fueling their own growth. Finally, the healthy bacterial strain in Biozome improves the soil structure and quality, keeping nutrients near the roots. Jobe\u2019s Organics Palm granular fertilizer is OMRI listed and may be used in certified organic food production according to the USDA National Organic Program. Jobe's Organics Cactus & Palm Potting Soil Mix and Jobe\u2019s Organics Palm Fertilizers will help your palm trees and plants thrive. Safe for use around children and pets."

You can place it in your living room, bedroom, office, balcony, or porch, and it can also help you water smaller plants near your windows, allowing your plants to thrive.",
            "\ud83d\udc8cNote: Since the spray painting of the plant stand is uniformly fixed by the machine and dried during the production, some blind areas of the inner seam and the shielded part of the bracket may have places where the painting is not in place, which is normal."
