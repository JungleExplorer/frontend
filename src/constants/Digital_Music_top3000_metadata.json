No color at all, save for the neighboring trees and the grass of the surrounding fields. Black-and-white stripes on grey sky; countless tents of varying shapes and sizes, with an elaborate wrought-iron fence encasing them in a colorless world. Even what little ground is visible from outside is black or white, painted or powdered, or treated with some other circus trick.But it is not open for business. Not just yet.Within hours everyone in town has heard about it. By afternoon the news has spread several towns over. Word of mouth is a more effective method of advertisement than typeset words and exclamation points on paper pamphlets or posters. It is impressive and unusual news, the sudden appearance of a mysterious circus. People marvel at the staggering height of the tallest tents.

No one has a proper answer, yet as dusk approaches there is a substantial crowd of spectators gathering outside the gates.You are amongst them, of course. Your curiosity got the better of you, as curiosity is wont to do. You stand in the fading light, the scarf around your neck pulled up against the chilly evening breeze, waiting to see for yourself exactly what kind of circus only opens once the sun sets.The ticket booth clearly visible behind the gates is closed and barred. The tents are still, save for when they ripple ever so slightly in the wind. The only movement within the circus is the clock that ticks by the passing minutes, if such a wonder of sculpture can even be called a clock.The circus looks abandoned and empty. But you think perhaps you can smell caramel wafting through the evening breeze, beneath the crisp scent of the autumn leaves. A subtle sweetness at the edges of the cold.The sun disappears completely beyond the horizon, and the remaining luminosity shifts from dusk to twilight. The people around you are growing restless from waiting, a sea of shuffling feet, murmuring about abandoning the endeavor in search of someplace warmer to pass the evening. You yourself are debating departing when it happens.First, there is a popping sound. It is barely audible over the wind and conversation. A soft noise like a kettle about to boil for tea. Then comes the light.All over the tents, small lights begin to flicker, as though the entirety of the circus is covered in particularly bright fireflies. The waiting crowd quiets as it watches this display of illumination. Someone near you gasps. A small child claps his hands with glee at the sight.When the tents are all aglow, sparkling against the night sky, the sign appears. Stretched across the top of the gates, hidden in curls of iron, more firefly-like lights flicker to life. They pop as they brighten, some accompanied by a shower of glowing white sparks and a bit of smoke.

            "UNEXPECTED POST",
            "New York, February 1873The man billed as Prospero the Enchanter receives a fair amount of correspondence via the theater office, but this is the first envelope addressed to him that contains a suicide note, and it is also the first to arrive carefully pinned to the coat of a five-year-old girl.The lawyer who escorts her to the theater refuses to explain despite the manager\u2019s protestations, abandoning her as quickly as he can with no more than a shrug and the tip of a hat.The theater manager does not need to read the envelope to know who the girl is for. The bright eyes peering out from under a cloud of unruly brown curls are smaller, wider versions of the magician\u2019s own.He takes her by the hand, her small fingers hanging limp within his. She refuses to remove her coat despite the warmth of the theater, giving only an adamant shake of her head when he asks her why.The manager takes the girl to his office, not knowing what else to do with her. She sits quietly on an uncomfortable chair beneath a line of framed posters advertising past productions, surrounded by boxes of tickets and receipts. The manager brings her a cup of tea with an extra lump of sugar, but it remains on the desk, untouched, and grows cold.The girl does not move, does not fidget in her seat. She stays perfectly still with her hands folded in her lap. Her gaze is fixed downward, focused on her boots that do not quite touch the floor. There is a small scuff on one toe, but the laces are knotted in perfect bows.The sealed envelope hangs from the second topmost button of her coat, until Prospero arrives.She hears him before the door opens, his footsteps heavy and echoing in the hall, unlike the measured pace of the manager who has come and gone several times, quiet as a cat.\u201cThere is also a\u2008.\u2008.\u2008.\u2008package for you, sir,\u201d the manager says as he opens the door, ushering the magician into the cramped office before slipping off to attend to other theater matters, having no desire to witness what might become of this encounter.The magician scans the office, a stack of letters in one hand, a black velvet cape lined with shockingly white silk cascading behind him, expecting a paper-wrapped box or crate. Only when the girl looks up at him with his own eyes does he realize what the theater manager was referring to.Prospero the Enchanter\u2019s immediate reaction upon meeting his daughter is a simple declaration of: \u201cWell, fuck.\u201dThe girl returns her attention to her boots.The magician closes the door behind him, dropping the stack of letters on the desk next to the teacup as he looks at the girl.He rips the envelope from her coat, leaving the pin clinging steadfastly to its button.While the writing on the front bears his stage name and the theater address, the letter inside greets him with his given name, Hector Bowen.He skims over the contents, any emotional impact desired by the author failing miserably and finally. He pauses at the only fact he deems relevant: that this girl now left in his custody is, obviously, his own daughter and that her name is Celia.\u201cShe should have named you Miranda,\u201d the man called Prospero the Enchanter says to the girl with a chuckle. \u201cI suppose she was not clever enough to think of it.\u201dThe girl looks up at him again. Dark eyes narrow beneath her curls.The teacup on the desk begins to shake. Ripples disrupt the calm surface as cracks tremble across the glaze, and then it collapses in shards of flowered porcelain. Cold tea pools in the saucer and drips onto the floor, leaving sticky trails along the polished wood.The magician\u2019s smile vanishes. He glances back at the desk with a frown, and the spilled tea begins seeping back up from the floor. The cracked and broken pieces stand and re-form themselves around the liquid until the cup sits complete once more, soft swirls of steam rising into the air.The girl stares at the teacup, her eyes wide.Hector Bowen takes his daughter\u2019s face in his gloved hand, scrutinizing her expression for a moment before releasing her, his fingers leaving long red marks across her cheeks.\u201cYou might be interesting,\u201d he says.The girl does not reply.He makes several attempts to rename her in the following weeks, but she refuses to respond to anything but Celia.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Several months later, once he decides she is ready, the magician writes a letter of his own.

            "At the edge of the continent, Crosby, Maine, may seem like nowhere, but seen through this brilliant writer\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s in essence the whole world, and the lives that are lived there are filled with all of the grand human drama - desire, despair, jealousy, hope, and love. At times stern, at other times patient, at times perceptive, at other times in sad denial, Olive Kitteridge, a retired schoolteacher, deplores the changes in her little town and in the world at large, but she doesn\u2019t always recognize the changes in those around her: a lounge musician haunted by a past romance; a former student who has lost the will to live; Olive\u2019s own adult child, who feels tyrannized by her irrational sensitivities; and her husband, Henry, who finds his loyalty to his marriage both a blessing and a curse. As the townspeople grapple with their problems, mild and dire, Olive is brought to a deeper understanding of herself and her life \u2013 sometimes painfully, but always with ruthless honesty. Olive Kitteridge offers profound insights into the human condition - its conflicts, its tragedies and joys, and the endurance it requires. 2009 Pulitzer Prize winner in the Letters, Drama and Music category"

            "BONUS FEATURE: Conversation between the author and the editor, David Fickling. Berlin 1942 When Bruno returns home from school one day, he discovers that his belongings are being packed in crates. His father has received a promotion and the family must move from their home to a new house far far away, where there is no one to play with and nothing to do. A tall fence running alongside stretches as far as the eye can see and cuts him off from the strange people he can see in the distance. But Bruno longs to be an explorer and decides that there must be more to this desolate new place than meets the eye. While exploring his new environment, he meets another boy whose life and circumstances are very different to his own, and their meeting results in a friendship that has devastating consequences."

            "THIS IS THE CD VERSION AND NOT THE VINYL VERSION. 2009 Digital Remaster / Enhanced / Digipack The classic original Beatles studio albums have been re-mastered by a dedicated team of engineers at Abbey Road Studios in London over a four-year period utilizing state of the art recording technology alongside vintage studio equipment, carefully maintaining the authenticity and integrity of the original analogue recordings. The result of this painstaking process is the highest fidelity the Beatles catalogue has seen since its original release. Within each CD's new packaging, booklets include detailed historical notes along with informative recording notes. For a limited period, each CD will also be embedded with a brief documentary film about the album. The newly produced mini-documentaries on the making of each album, directed by Bob Smeaton, are included as QuickTime files on each album. The documentaries contain archival footage, rare photographs and never-before-heard studio chat from The Beatles, offering a unique and very personal insight into the studio atmosphere. Tracklisting: 1. Come Together 2. Something 3. Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer 4. Oh! Darling 5. Octopus\u2019s Garden 6. I Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy) 7. Here Comes The Sun 8. Because 9. You Never Give Me Your Money 10. Sun King 11. Mean Mr. Mustard 12. Polythene Pam 13. She Came In Through The Bathroom Window 14. Golden Slumbers 15. Carry That Weight 16. The End 17. Her Majesty 18.

            "The Poisonwood Bible is a story told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them all they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it - from garden seeds to Scripture - is calamitously transformed on African soil. This tale of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction, over the course of three decades in postcolonial Africa, is set against history's most dramatic political parables. The Poisonwood Bible dances between the darkly comic human failings and inspiring poetic justices of our times. In a compelling exploration of religion, conscience, imperialist arrogance, and the many paths to redemption, Barbara Kingsolver has brought forth her most ambitious work ever."

He\u2019d been sleeping rough. Probably homeless. No identification. A slip of paper with Millhone\u2019s name and number was in his pants pocket. The coroner asked her to come to the morgue to see if she could ID him. Two seemingly unrelated deaths, one a murder, the other apparently of natural causes.But as Kinsey digs deeper into the mystery of the John Doe, some very strange linkages begin to emerge. Not just between the two victims, but also to Kinsey\u2019s past. And before long Kinsey, through no fault of her own, is thoroughly compromised\u2026",

            "Wasted lives, wasted time, and wasted opportunities are at the heart of this twenty-third entry in the long-running Kinsey Millhone series, which reveals how the deaths of two very different men impact Kinsey\u2019s life. The first man, Pete Wolinsky, found murdered in a local park, is a shady PI for whom Kinsey has little respect; the second, R. T. Dace, is an alcoholic vagrant who not only turns out to be Kinsey\u2019s relative but also leaves her a half-million bucks. Armed with news of R. T.\u2019s death, Kinsey sets out to learn more about him and why he disinherited his immediate family. The clever twists of V Is for Vengeance are mostly absent here, and readers will need to wade through a lot of story before Wolinsky\u2019s connection to Dace comes clear. But Grafton hasn\u2019t lost her touch for characterization. Nobody in the cast is a stereotype, and it\u2019s the clash of personalities and interpersonal dynamics that provide the appeal here. Nearing the conclusion of this celebrated series, Grafton continues to shape Millhone\u2019s character, toughened by circumstance but still both understanding and forgiving. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: As the end of the alphabet draws closer, expect a revival of interest in a series that has helped define the role of the female sleuth in mystery fiction. --Stephanie Zvirin",

            "PROLOGUE",
            "Two dead men changed the course of my life that fall. One of them I knew and the other I\u2019d never laid eyes on until I saw him in the morgue. The first was Pete Wolinsky, an unscrupulous private detective I\u2019d met years before through Byrd-Shine Investigations, where I\u2019d served my apprenticeship. I worked for Ben Byrd and Morley Shine for three years, amassing the six thousand hours I needed for my license. The two were old-school private eyes, hard-working, tireless, and inventive. While Ben and Morley did business with Pete on occasion, they didn\u2019t think much of him. He was morally shabby, disorganized, and irresponsible with money. In addition, he was constantly pestering them for work, since his marketing skills were minimal and his reputation too dubious to recommend him without an outside push. Byrd-Shine might subcontract the odd stretch of surveillance to him or assign him a routine records search, but his name never appeared on a client report. This didn\u2019t prevent him from stopping by the office without invitation or dropping their names in casual conversations with attorneys, implying a close professional relationship. Pete was a man who cut corners and he assumed his colleagues did likewise. More problematic was the fact that he\u2019d rationalized his bad behavior for so long it had become standard operating procedure.",
            "Pete Wolinsky was gunned down the night of August 25 on a dark stretch of pavement just off the parking lot at the Santa Teresa Bird Refuge. The site was right across the street from the Caliente Caf\u00e9, a popular hangout for off-duty cops. It might seem odd that no one in the bar was aware that shots were fired, but the volume on the jukebox exceeds 117 dB, roughly the equivalent of a gas-powered chainsaw at a distance of three feet. The rare moments of quiet are masked by the high-pitched rattle of ice cubes in dueling blenders where margaritas are whipped up at a rate of one every four and a half minutes.",
            "Pete\u2019s body might not have been discovered until daylight if it hadn\u2019t been for an inebriated bar patron who stepped into the shadows to take a leak. I heard about Pete\u2019s death on the morning news while I was eating my Cheerios. The TV set was on in the living room behind me, more for the company than the content. I caught his name and turned to catch a night shot of the crime scene blocked off by yellow tape. By the time the news crew had arrived, his body had been loaded into the ambulance in preparation for transport to the coroner\u2019s office, so there was really nothing to see. In the harsh glare of artificial light, a somber female reporter recited the bare facts. Pete\u2019s immediate family must have been notified by then or she wouldn\u2019t have mentioned him by name. Pete\u2019s death was a surprise, but I can\u2019t say it was a shock. He\u2019d often complained of sleeping poorly and had taken to wandering the streets at all hours. According to the reporter, his wallet had been stolen along with his watch, a knock-off Rolex with a faux-platinum band. I guess robbers these days can\u2019t distinguish the genuine article from the fake, which meant that Pete\u2019s death wound up being more about impulse or cheap thrills than profit. He was a man with a propensity for risk, and it was only a matter of time before Lady Luck caught up with him and pushed him off the cliff.",
            "The story about the second dead man is more complex and takes longer to articulate, especially since the facts emerged slowly over a matter of weeks. The coroner\u2019s office called me on a Friday afternoon, asking if I could ID a John Doe who had my name and phone number on a slip of paper in his pocket. How could I resist? Every good mystery takes place on three planes\u2014what",
            "really",
            "happened; what",
            "appears",
            "to have happened; and how the sleuth, amateur or professional (yours truly in this case), figures out which is which. I suppose I could put everything in perspective if I explained how it all turned out and then doubled back to that phone call, but it\u2019s better if you experience it just as I did, one strange step at a time.",
            "This was October 7, 1988, and it looked like things were as bad as they were going to get. On the national front, congressional spending was a whopping $1,064.14 billion and the federal debt was topping out at $2,601.3 billion. Unemployment hovered at 5.5 percent and the price of a first-class postage stamp had jumped from twenty-two cents to twenty-five. I tend to disregard issues over which I have no control. Like it or not, the politicians don\u2019t consult me about economic policies, budget cuts, or the gross national product, whatever",
            "that",
            "is. I might voice an opinion (if I had one), but as nearly as I can tell, nobody pays the slightest attention, so what\u2019s the point? My only hope is to be the master of my own small universe, which is centered in a Southern California town ninety-six miles north of Los Angeles.",
            "My name is Kinsey Millhone. I\u2019m a private investigator, female, age thirty-eight. I rent office space in a two-room bungalow with a kitchenette and a bathroom on a narrow side street in the heart of Santa Teresa, population 85,810, minus the two dead guys. Since I\u2019m the sole proprietor and lone employee, I operate on a modest scale, supporting myself by doing missing-persons searches, background checks, witness location, and the occasional service of process. From time to time I\u2019m hired to establish paper trails in legal, financial, or property disputes. On a more personal note, let me say that I believe in law and order, loyalty, and patriotism\u2014old-fashioned values that might seem woefully out of date. I also believe in earning an honest living so I can pay my taxes, cover my monthly bills, and tuck any surplus into my retirement account.",
            "When I reached the coroner\u2019s office, I was ushered into a bay with the curtain discreetly pulled around the ceiling track. Though curious, I wasn\u2019t apprehensive. I\u2019d done a quick survey and could account for the people I knew and loved. There were those who orbited my world in a wider gyre, but I couldn\u2019t think of one whose death would have had a significant impact.",
            "The dead man was stretched out on a gurney with a sheet pulled up to his chin, so there was nothing of an intimate nature in evidence. He was not someone I recognized. His skin tones were gray, underlined with a pale gold that suggested liver issues of a profound and possibly fatal nature. His features had been softened and flattened in death, angles worn as smooth as stone over which water has poured for thousands of years. The human spirit does more than animate the face; it lends character and definition. Here, there was none.",
            "The decedent (to use the official term) appeared to be in his early seventies, white, and overweight in the manner of those who forgo their nine servings of fresh fruits and vegetables per day. Judging by the bulbous nose and broken veins across his weather-darkened face, he\u2019d enjoyed alcohol in sufficient quantities to pickle the average adult. Sometimes the dead seem to sleep. This man did not. I studied him at length, and there was not even the faintest suggestion that he was breathing. Whatever spell had been cast over him, the effects were permanent.",
            "His body had been discovered that morning in a sleeping bag on the beach where he\u2019d hollowed out a place for himself in the sand. His campsite was just below a bank of ice plant that flourished between the bike path and the beach itself, a spot not immediately visible to passersby. During the day, the area is popular with the homeless. At night, the fortunate among them secure bed space at one of the local shelters. The unlucky ones are left to flop where they can.",
            "The beachside park closes thirty minutes after sunset and doesn\u2019t open again until 6:00 A.M. According to Municipal Code 15.16.085, it\u2019s unlawful to sleep in any public park, public street, public parking lot, or any public beach, which doesn\u2019t leave much in the way of open-air habitats available free of charge. The ordinance is designed to discourage transients from sacking out on the doorsteps of area businesses, thus forcing them to set up makeshift quarters under bridges, freeway overpasses, bushes, and other places of concealment. Sometimes the police roust them out and sometimes they look the other way. Much of this depends on whether the local citizens are feeling righteous about the poor or indifferent, as is usually the case.",
            "Preliminary examination suggested the man had been dead for close to eighteen hours by the time the coroner\u2019s investigator got in touch with me. Aaron Blumberg had been hired by the Santa Teresa County Coroner\u2019s Office in the mid-\u201970s, just about the time I left the Santa Teresa Police Department and went to work for Ben Byrd and Morley Shine. The year I opened my office, Aaron was recruited by the Kern County Sheriff\u2019s Department, from which he\u2019d recently retired. Like many law-enforcement junkies, he was ill suited for a life of leisure, and he\u2019d returned to the local coroner\u2019s office some six months before.",
            "He was a man in his sixties with a softly receding hairline. The top of his head was covered with gray fluff, like the first feathering out of a baby bird. His ears were prominent, his cheekbones pronounced, and his smile created long creases that bracketed his mouth like a marionette\u2019s. We stood in silence for a moment and then he checked my reaction. \u201cYou know him?\u201d",

            "\u201cWho called it in?\u201d",
            "He took off his glasses and polished one lens with the end of his tie. \u201cFellow named Cross. Seven o\u2019clock this morning, he was out on the beach with a metal detector sweeping for coins. He had his eye on the sleeping bag, thinking it had been dumped. Something about it bothered him, so he went out to the street and flagged down the first black-and-white that came by.\u201d",
            "\u201cWas anyone else around?\u201d",
            "\u201cThe usual posse of bums, but by the time the paramedics arrived, they\u2019d all drifted away.\u201d He checked his lenses for smears and then resettled the glasses on his nose, tucking a wire stem carefully behind each ear.",

            "\u201cNothing obvious. Dr. Palchek\u2019s on her way out. She has two autopsies on the books, which puts this guy at the end of the line, pending her assessment. Since Medicare went into effect, she doesn\u2019t do a post on every body brought in.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat do you think he died of? He looks jaundiced.\u201d",
            "\u201cNot to be flip about it, but what do any of these guys die of? It\u2019s a hard life. We have one just like this every couple of months. Guy goes to sleep and he never wakes up.

The note was written in ballpoint pen, the letters uniform and clean: MILLHONE INVESTIGATIONS with the address and phone.

            "I sat for a moment in the parking lot, jotting notes on a succession of index cards that I keep in my bag. There was a time when I trusted more to memory. I was raised by a maiden aunt who believed in rote learning: multiplication tables, state capitals, the kings and queens of England and their reigns, religions of the world, and the periodic table of elements, which she taught me by the judicious arrangement of cookies decorated with blue, pink, yellow, and green frosting, numbers piped onto each in a contrasting color. Oddly enough, I\u2019d forgotten that particular exercise in child abuse until the previous April, when I walked into a bakery and saw a display of Easter cookies. In a flash, like a series of photographs, I saw hydrogen, atomic number 1; helium, atomic number 2; lithium, atomic number 3, working my way as far as neon, atomic number 10, before my mind went blank. I am still able to recite long portions of Alfred Noyes\u2019s \u201cThe Highwayman\u201d at the slightest provocation. In my experience, this is not a useful skill.",
            "When I was young, such pointless mental gymnastics were the perfect training for a game played at various birthday parties I attended. We were briefly shown a tray of objects, and a prize was given to the little girl who remembered the most. I was a whiz at this. In fourth grade, I won a pocket comb, a ChapStick, a small bag of marbles, a box of crayons, a nicely wrapped bar of motel soap, and a pair of plastic barrettes\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. really not worth the effort in my opinion. Eventually, mothers became annoyed and hinted broadly that I should share the bounty or cede the floor. Having a keen sense of justice even at that age, I refused, which pared down the number of invitations to zero. I\u2019ve learned in the years since that the simple expedient of written notes relieves the beleaguered child in me from burdening my brain. I\u2019m still resistant to sharing bounty I\u2019ve acquired by fair means.",
            "Pulling out of the parking lot, I thought about the oddities of life, that something as insignificant as a slip of paper could have a ripple effect. For reasons unknown, the dead man had made a note of my name and phone number, and because of that, my path had touched his. While it was too late for conversation, I wasn\u2019t quite prepared to shrug and move on. Maybe he\u2019d meant to make the call the day he died and his mortality caught up with him before he could act. Maybe he\u2019d thought about calling and changed his mind. I wasn\u2019t looking for answers, but it couldn\u2019t hurt to inquire. I didn\u2019t anticipate long-term consequences. I pictured myself asking a few questions, making little or no progress, and then letting the matter drop. Sometimes the import of a minor moment makes all the difference.",

            "On my way back into town, I stopped at the car wash. For years I owned VW Bugs, which were cheap to run and possessed a certain quirky charm. A full tank of gas would get you almost anywhere in the state, and if you suffered a fender bender, you could replace a bumper for pennies on the dollar. This more than made up for the minimal horsepower and the smirks from other drivers. I\u2019m a jeans-and-boots kind of gal myself, so the lack of glamour suited me just fine.",
            "My first VW, a beige 1968 sedan, ended up in a ditch after a fellow in a truck ran me off the road. This was out by the Salton Sea, where I was conducting a missing-persons search. The guy was intent on killing me but managed to inflict only modest damage to my person while the car was a total loss. My second VW sedan was a 1974, pale blue, with only one minor ding in the left rear fender. That car went to an early grave, shoved into a big hole after a slow-speed chase on an isolated stretch of road up in San Luis Obispo County. I\u2019ve heard that most traffic fatalities occur within a two-mile radius of home, but my experience would suggest otherwise. I don\u2019t mean to imply that the life of a private eye is all that dangerous. The big threat is my being bored half to death doing title searches at the county courthouse.",
            "My current vehicle is a 1970 Ford Mustang, a two-door coupe with manual transmission, a front spoiler, and wide track tires. This car had served me well, but the color was an eye-popping Grabber Blue, much too conspicuous for someone in my line of work. Occasionally I\u2019m hired to run surveillance on an unsuspecting spouse, and the persistent sight of a Boss 429 in close range will blow a tail every time. I\u2019d owned the Mustang for a year, and while I was no longer smitten with it, I was reconciled to Mustang ownership until the next kick-ass miscreant had a go at me. I figured I was just about due.",
            "In the meantime, I tried to be conscientious about maintenance, with frequent servicing at the local repair shop and a weekly hosing down. At the car wash for $9.99, the \u201cdeluxe package\u201d includes a thorough interior vacuuming, a foam wash, a rinse, a hot wax, and a blow dry with 60-horsepower fans. Ticket in hand, I watched the attendant ease the Mustang into a line of cars awaiting the conveyor track, which would ferry it from view. I went inside the station and paid the cashier, declining the offer of a vanilla-scented doohickey to hang on my rearview mirror. I moved over to the waiting area\u2019s long spectator window and peered to my right, watching as the attendant steered the Mustang forward until it was caught on the flat mechanical tramway. A white hatchback of unknown manufacture followed right behind.",
            "Four panels of trailing cloth bands wagged soap and water back and forth across the top surfaces of the car while whirling cloth skirts pirouetted along the sides. A separate cylinder of soft brushes caught the front grille, merrily scrubbing and polishing. There was something hypnotic about the methodical lather and rinse processes that enveloped the Mustang in a blanket of sudsy water, soap, and wax. That I considered the process enthralling is a fair gauge of how easily entertained I was at the time.",
            "I was so engrossed that I scarcely noticed the guy standing at the window next to me until he spoke.",
            "\u201cThat your Mustang?\u201d",
            "\u201cYep,\u201d I said and looked over at him. I placed him in his early forties, dark hair, good jawline, slender frame. Not so good-looking as to annoy or intimidate. He wore boots, faded jeans, and a blue denim shirt with the sleeves rolled up. His smile revealed a row of white teeth with one crooked bicuspid.",
            "\u201cAre you a fan?\u201d I asked.",
            "\u201cOh, god yes. My older brother had a 429 when he was in high school. Man, you floored that thing and it tore the blacktop off the road. Is that a 1969?\u201d",
            "\u201cClose, a 1970. The intake ports are the size of sewer pipes.\u201d",
            "\u201cThey\u2019d have to be. What\u2019s the airflow rate?\u201d",
            "\u201cEight,\u201d I said, like I knew what I was talking about. I walked the length of the station\u2019s window, keeping pace with my car as it inched down the line. \u201cIs that your hatchback?\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d he said. \u201cI liked the car when I bought it, but it\u2019s one thing after another. I\u2019ve taken it back to the dealer three times and they claim there\u2019s nothing they can do.\u201d",
            "Both cars disappeared from view, and as we moved toward the exit, he stepped ahead of me and pushed open the glass door, holding it for me as I passed in front of him. One car jockey slid into the front seat of the Mustang while another took the wheel of his car, which I could see now was a Nissan. Both cars were driven out onto the tarmac, where two sets of workers swarmed forward with terry-cloth towels, wiping away stray traces of water and squirting shiner on the sides of the tires. A minute later, one of the workers raised a towel, looking over at us.",
            "As I headed for my car, the Nissan owner said, \u201cYou ever decide to sell, post a notice on the board in there.\u201d",
            "I turned and walked backward for a few steps. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been thinking about dumping it.\u201d",
            "He laughed, glancing over as a second worker nodded to indicate that his car was ready.",
            "I said, \u201cI\u2019m serious. It\u2019s the wrong car for me.\u201d",
            "\u201cHow so?\u201d",
            "\u201cI bought it on a whim and I\u2019ve regretted it ever since. I have all the service records and the tires are brand new. And no, it\u2019s not stolen. I own it outright.\u201d",
            "\u201cHow much?\u201d",
            "\u201cI paid five grand and I\u2019d be willing to let it go for that.\u201d",
            "By then he\u2019d caught up with me and we\u2019d stopped to finish the conversation. \u201cYou mean it?\u201d",
            "\u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m open to the idea.\u201d I reached into one of the outer flaps of my shoulder bag and took out a business card. I scribbled my home phone number on the back and offered it to him.",
            "He glanced at the information. \u201cWell, okay. This is good. I don\u2019t have the money now, but I might one day soon.\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019d have to line up a replacement. I need wheels or I\u2019m out of business.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you think about it and I will, too. A friend of mine owes me money and he swears he\u2019ll pay.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou have a name?\u201d",
            "\u201cDrew Unser. Actually, it\u2019s Andrew, but Drew\u2019s easier.\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019m Kinsey.\u201d",
            "\u201cI know.\u201d He held the card up. \u201cIt says so right here.\u201d",
            "\u201cHave a good one,\u201d I said. I continued to my car and then waved as I got in. The last I saw of him, he was heading left out of the lot while I took a right.",
            "I returned to the office and spent a satisfying half hour at my Smith-Corona typing a report. The job I\u2019d just wrapped up was a work-related disability claim through California Fidelity Insurance, where I\u2019d been accorded office space for many years. Since CFI and I had parted on bad terms, I appreciated the opportunity to ingratiate myself, a reversal made possible because the executive who fired me had himself been fired. This was a gloat-worthy turn of events and the news had lifted my spirits for days. The recent job had been gratifying for more reasons than the hefty paycheck. The responsibility of an employer for the health and safety of employees is governed by state law, and the follow-up to a workplace accident usually falls to the insurance company. Not all private insurance companies write worker-comp policies, which requires a property and casualty license. In this case, the injured man was married to a CFI executive, which was why I was brought in. Being skeptical by nature, I suspected the fellow was malingering, coached by a spouse well acquainted with the means and methods for milking the situation. As it turned out, I was able to document the man\u2019s incapacitation, and his employer made sure he was afforded the benefits he was entitled to. Cynicism aside, it makes me happy when two parties, whose relationship could turn adversarial, resolve their differences to the satisfaction of both.",
            "When I finished typing the report, I made two copies on my newly acquired secondhand copy machine, kept one for my files, and put the original and one copy in an envelope that I addressed to CFI, which I dropped into the nearest mailbox as I headed for home. I was caught up on work, and for the moment I had no new clients clamoring for my services, so I\u2019d awarded myself some time off. I wasn\u2019t thinking in terms of a bona fide vacation. I\u2019m too tight with a buck to spend money on a trip and there wasn\u2019t any place else I longed to be in any event. As a rule, if I don\u2019t work, I don\u2019t eat, but my checking account was full, I had three months\u2019 worth of expenses covered, and I was looking forward to a stretch of time in which to do as I pleased.",
            "Once I\u2019d reached Cabana, I followed the wide boulevard that ran parallel to the Pacific Ocean. We\u2019d had fog and drizzle the day before and the skies were sufficiently overcast to generate a fine mist. As it happened, rainfall total for the month would later register a touch over 0.00 inches, but for all I knew, the sprinkle heralded an epic tropical storm that would soak us properly. The lingering damp suggested a change of seasons, Santa Teresa\u2019s version of summer giving way to fall.",
            "A mile farther on, at the intersection of Milagro and Cabana, I turned into one of the public lots and nosed into a parking spot that faced the Santa Teresa Inn. I figured as long as I was out and about, I\u2019d try to make contact with those who might be acquainted with the man in the morgue. This was a neighborhood I knew well, the halfway point in my usual three-mile morning jog. It was now late afternoon and the beach path was populated by a cross-flow of walkers and cyclists, tourists peddling foot-powered surreys, and kids maneuvering their skateboards as though surfing the pipeline.",
            "The homeless I saw in the early morning hours were often still huddled under a deadweight of blankets, sheltered by shopping carts piled high with their belongings. Even for nomads, the urge toward ownership is apparently irresistible. Regardless of social status, we derive comfort from our",
            "stuff",
            "; the familiar warp and weft of our lives. My pillow, my blanket, my small plot of earth. It\u2019s not that the homeless are any less invested in their possessions. The dimensions of what they own are simply more compact and more easily carted from place to place.",
            "The sun was making its slow descent and the air was getting chillier by the minute. I set my sights on a trio lounging on sleeping bags under a cluster of palms. As I watched, they passed a cigarette from hand to hand and took turns sipping from a soda can that had probably been emptied and refilled with a high-test substitute. In addition to the censure against snoozing in public, consumption of alcohol is also prohibited by municipal code. Clearly, the homeless can\u2019t do much of anything without risking arrest.",
            "It didn\u2019t take much sleuthing to locate the spot where the John Doe had been found. Just beyond a shelf of ice plant, someone had constructed a tower of carefully balanced rocks, six by my count, each stone settled on the one below it in an artful arrangement that appeared both stable and precarious. I knew the sculpture hadn\u2019t been there the day before because I\u2019d have spotted it. At the base, a motley collection of glass jars had been placed, each containing a bouquet of wildflowers or blooms confiscated from the yards of homeowners in the area. While jogging, the only way I have to keep my mind occupied is by a free-form internal commentary about external events.",
            "I focused on the three transients, two of whom were regarding me without expression. They didn\u2019t seem overtly threatening, but I\u2019m an undersize female\u2014five foot six, one hundred eighteen pounds\u2014and while capable of defending myself, I\u2019d been taught to keep my distance from any assemblage of idlers. There\u2019s something edgy and unpredictable about those who loiter with no clear purpose, especially when alcohol is folded into the mix. I\u2019m a person of order and regulation, discipline and routine. That\u2019s what makes me feel safe. The anarchy of the disenfranchised is worrisome. In this case, my wariness was superseded by my quest for information.",
            "I approached the threesome, taking a mental photograph of each in turn. A white kid somewhere in his twenties sat with his back against a palm. He sported dreadlocks. The sparse shadow of facial hair suggested he\u2019d shaved maybe once in the past two weeks. I could see a sharp angle of bare chest visible in the V of his short-sleeve shirt. The sight of his bare arms made me cross my own for warmth. His shorts seemed light for the season. The only items of substance he wore were heavy-duty wool socks and a pair of hiking boots. His legs were cute, but that was about it.",
            "The second fellow was African American, with a full head of springy gray hair, frosted with white. His beard and mustache were carefully trimmed, and he wore glasses with metal rims. He was probably in his seventies, decked out in a pale blue dress shirt under a herringbone sport coat with frayed cuffs. The third fellow sat cross-legged in the grass with his back to me, as round-shouldered and squat as a statue of Buddha. He wore an imitation leather jacket with a rip under one arm and a black knit watch cap pulled down to his brows.",
            "I said, \u201cHi, guys. I don\u2019t mean to intrude, but did any of you know the dead man who was found out there this morning in his sleeping bag?\u201d",
            "As I gestured toward the beach, it occurred to me that the detail about the sleeping bag was superfluous. How many dead men in any guise had been discovered at the beach in the past twenty-four hours?",
            "The fellow with his back to me rotated to get a good look at me and I realized my mistake. It was a woman, who said, \u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d",
            "\u201cSorry. I should have introduced myself. Kinsey Millhone. What\u2019s your name?\u201d",
            "She turned away, murmuring a four-letter word, which was audible, owing to my keen appreciation of bad language. I\u2019m occasionally rebuked for my salty tongue, but who gives a shit?",
            "The white kid spoke up in an effort to present a friendlier point of view. Without quite meeting my gaze, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s Pearl. This here\u2019s Dandy and I\u2019m Felix.\u201d",
            "\u201cNice meeting you,\u201d I said.",
            "In a gesture that I hoped would convey both goodwill and trust, I held out my hand. There was an awkward moment and then Felix got the message. He shook hands with me, smiling sheepishly, his gaze fixed on the grass. I could see grungy metal braces on his teeth. Was the welfare system in the business of correcting malocclusions these days? That was hard to believe. Maybe he\u2019d been fitted as a teen and had run away from home before his dentist finished his work. His teeth did look straight, but I questioned the wisdom of sporting orthodontia for life.",
            "Dandy, the older gentleman, spoke up, his tone mild. \u201cDon\u2019t mind Pearl. It\u2019s almost supper time and she\u2019s hypoglycemic. Brings out a side of her we\u2019d just as soon not see. What\u2019s your interest in our friend?\u201d",
            "\u201cHe had my name and phone number in his pocket. The coroner\u2019s office asked me to ID the guy, but I\u2019d never seen him before. Were you aware that he\u2019d passed away?\u201d",
            "Pearl snorted. \u201cWe look like fools? Of course he\u2019s",
            "dead",
            ". Why else would the coroner send a van? He was laying out there still as stone an hour and a half after sunup. Down here, come daybreak, you better be on the move or the cops will bust you for loitering.\u201d Her lower teeth were dark and widely spaced as though every other one had been yanked out.",
            "\u201cCan you tell me his name?\u201d",
            "She measured me, sizing up my capacity to pay. \u201cHow much is it worth to you?\u201d",
            "Dandy said, \u201cCome on now, Pearl. Why don\u2019t you answer the lady? She asked all polite and look how you\u2019re doing her.\u201d",
            "\u201cWould you butt out? I can handle this myself if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d",
            "\u201cFellow passed on. She wants to know who he is. No reason to be rude.\u201d",
            "\u201cI asked why it\u2019s any of her concern? She ain\u2019t answer me, so why should I answer her?\u201d",
            "I said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing complicated going on. The coroner\u2019s office wants to contact his next of kin so his family can decide what to do with his remains. I\u2019d hate to see him buried in a pauper\u2019s grave.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat difference does it make as long as it don\u2019t cost us anything?\u201d",
            "Her hostility was getting on my nerves, but I didn\u2019t think this was the time to introduce the notion of sensitivity training when she was already \u201csharing\u201d her feelings. She went on. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you? You a social worker? Is that it? You work for St. Terry\u2019s or that clinic at the university?\u201d",
            "I was doing an admirable job of keeping my temper in check. Nothing sets me off quicker than belligerence, warranted or otherwise. \u201cI\u2019m a private investigator. Your friend must have found my name in the yellow pages. I wondered if he\u2019d had a problem he needed help with.\u201d",
            "\u201cWe all need help,\u201d Pearl said. She held out a hand to Dandy. \u201cGimme up.\u201d",
            "He stood and pulled her to her feet. I watched while she dusted imaginary blades of grass from the back of her pants.",
            "\u201cNice making your acquaintance,\u201d Dandy said.",
            "The white kid took his cue from his companions and stubbed out the last half inch of the cigarette. He stood and took one last sip from the soda can before he crushed it underfoot. He might have left it in the grass, but since I was standing right there watching him, he tucked it in his backpack like a good Boy Scout. He gathered his sleeping bag, bundled it carelessly, and secured it to his backpack with a length of rope.",
            "Clearly, our chummy conversation was coming to an end. I said, \u201cAnybody know where he was from?\u201d",
            "No response.",
            "\u201cCan\u2019t you even give me a hint?\u201d",
            "The white kid said, \u201cTerrence.\u201d",
            "Pearl hissed, trying to shut him up.",
            "Meanwhile, I was drawing a blank. \u201cWhich is where?\u201d",
            "Felix was staring off to one side. \u201cYou ast his first name.\u201d",
            "\u201cGot it. Terrence. I appreciate the information. What about his last name?\u201d",
            "\u201cHey! Enough. We don\u2019t have to tell you nothing,\u201d Pearl said.",
            "I was about to choke the woman to death with my bare hands when Dandy spoke up.",
            "\u201cYou have a business card? I\u2019m not saying we\u2019ll get back to you, but just in case.\u201d",
            "\u201cOf course.\u201d",
            "I reached into my shoulder bag and took one out, which I handed to him. \u201cI jog most weekday mornings, so you can always look for me on the bike path. I\u2019m usually here by six fifteen.\u201d",
            "He examined the card. \u201cWhat kind of name\u2019s Kinsey?\u201d",
            "\u201cMy mother\u2019s maiden name.\u201d",
            "He looked up. \u201cYou happen to have any spare smokes on you?\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I said, patting my jacket as though to verify the fact. I was about to add that I didn\u2019t have any spare change either, but it seemed insulting as he hadn\u2019t inquired about my financial state. Pearl had lost interest. She grabbed her shopping cart and began hauling it toward the bike path, wheels digging into the soft grass.",
            "When it was clear the three were moving on, I said, \u201cI appreciate your help. If you think of anything useful, you can let me know.\u201d",
            "Dandy paused. \u201cYou know that minimart a block down?\u201d",
            "\u201cSure.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou pick up a couple packs of cigarettes and it might put Miss Pearly White in a mood to chat.\u201d",
            "\u201cShe can bite my big fat ass,\u201d Pearl said.",
            "\u201cThanks a bunch. Really fun,\u201d I sang as they ambled away.",
            "2",
            "I retraced my route, this time hanging a right onto Bay and then a left onto Albanil. I found a parking place two doors down from my studio and let myself in through the squeaking gate. I continued around to the backyard and skirted the flagstone patio. I unlocked my door and tossed my shoulder bag on a kitchen stool.",
            "My studio was created when my eighty-eight-year-old landlord, Henry Pitts, built a spacious new two-car garage and converted his former one-car garage into a rental unit. At the time I was looking for a place near the beach. I\u2019d been scouting the area on foot in hopes of spotting a For Rent sign when I came across the notice he\u2019d posted in the neighborhood laundromat. We met, chatted briefly, and agreed to a three-month trial period during which we could decide if the arrangement suited us.",
            "From the first, I thought he was adorable\u2014tall and lean, with bright blue eyes, a healthy head of white hair, and a wicked smile. As it turned out, Henry and I were perfect for one another, not in any romantic sense, but as good friends living close to each other. Not infrequently I\u2019m on the road for work purposes, and during the periods when I\u2019m home I tend to keep to myself. Henry is similarly self-sufficient and as committed to independence as I am. I\u2019m tidy and quiet. He\u2019s tidy and gregarious, with a strong sense of decorum, which means he minds his own business unless I\u2019m in need of a dressing-down, as is sometimes the case. He\u2019s a retired commercial baker and he was happy to have someone on whom to lavish his freshly made cinnamon rolls and chocolate-chunk brownies. Soon we were making the trek to the neighborhood tavern for dinner a couple of nights a week. He would also issue an impromptu dinner invitation when he\u2019d made a beef stew or a big pot of vegetable soup.",
            "When I first moved in, I was thirty-two years old and he was eighty-two, an age gap I considered negligible. What\u2019s fifty years\u2019 difference between friends? I\u2019ve been his tenant now for going on seven years and can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else. The only blip on the radar screen was an unfortunate incident when a bomb exploded and blew the roof off my place. Henry assumed the role of general contractor during the reconstruction, redesigning and furnishing the whole of it as though he\u2019d been doing it all his life. He fashioned the remodel after a ship\u2019s interior, complete with a porthole in the front door.",
            "Given the plunging late-afternoon temperatures, I was happy to be back in my cozy little place. The space is compact. Numerous built-in cabinets and cubbyholes provide more storage space than you\u2019d think possible. Though a mere fifteen feet on a side, the downstairs comprises a living room, a makeshift corner office, a full bath, and a five-foot bump-out to accommodate a galley-style kitchen. A small spiral staircase leads up to a sleeping loft with a Plexiglas skylight above the bed and a bathroom with a window at tub level that looks out into the trees.",
            "By way of modern conveniences, I have a stacking washer and dryer, a microwave oven, and a lightweight vacuum cleaner for my few square yards of cotton shag wall-to-wall carpet. I don\u2019t often cook, unless you want to count heating a can of tomato soup as a culinary accomplishment. Those of us who don\u2019t cook seldom have to worry about a sink full of dirty dishes, so a dishwasher would have been beside the point. After breakfast, I wash my cereal bowl and spoon, juice glass, and coffee mug, and leave them in the dish rack to air-dry until I need them again. Lunches I eat out, except for days when I take a sandwich, an apple, and cookies to munch while I\u2019m sitting at my desk. On the rare nights when I have dinner at home, I put together one of my favorite sandwiches and serve it on a folded paper towel that I can then toss in the trash. This, by the way, is yet another argument for being single. Whatever I choose to do, there\u2019s no one to complain.",
            "Henry was tied up that night, catering a small dinner party for Moza Lowenstein down the street. Rosie\u2019s Tavern was closed for the week because Rosie and William had flown to Flint, Michigan, the day before to help care for Henry and William\u2019s sister, Nell, who had undergone a second surgery on the hip she\u2019d broken in the spring. She was just getting out of rehab, and Rosie and William had agreed to be on hand until the following Friday, offering assistance when she was discharged. William is Henry\u2019s brother, older by one year. Their sister, Nell, at ninety-nine, is the oldest of the five Pitts \u201ckids,\u201d with Charlie and Lewis, ages ninety-one and ninety-six respectively, filling in the gap.",
            "An addendum to the plan was that Rosie was having her building fumigated while they were out of town. In anticipation of the process, the restaurant kitchen and storage areas had been emptied, and Henry\u2019s second and third bedrooms were now jammed with all manner of foodstuffs. I didn\u2019t inquire too closely what had motivated the purge. Rosie\u2019s devil-may-care Hungarian dishes often feature animal organs, finely minced and sauced with a slurry of alarming black specks and chewy bits.

            "I knew Henry would report on the family drama at the first opportunity, which I anticipated in the next few days. In the meantime, I was on my own, a happy circumstance for someone of my sometimes prickly disposition. I changed into my sweats and put together a deluxe hot hard-boiled-egg sandwich and poured myself a glass of Chardonnay. After supper, I curled up on the sofa with a mystery novel until I put myself to bed.",

            "The next day, Saturday, I cruised the beach area hoping to see my homeless pals. I didn\u2019t intend to make this my life\u2019s work. I thought the coroner\u2019s office had a better chance than I did of picking up a proper ID on Terrence Last-Name-Unknown. However, since I\u2019d scored the dead man\u2019s first name the day before, my modest success was now spurring me on. Pearl\u2019s antagonism was a motivating factor as well. If she\u2019d known me better\u2014or at all\u2014she\u2019d have realized that her surliness was more of a challenge than an insult.",
            "I was still debating the purchase of the cigarettes Dandy had implied might open the floodgates where Terrence was concerned. I questioned the ethics of supplying the trio with tobacco products as a means to an end. Given current scientific research, I think it\u2019s fair to point out that smoking\u2019s not a healthy practice, and I was reluctant to foster the habit among those who could ill afford it. On the other hand, as Pearl had so tartly observed in our first conversation, what business was it of mine?",
            "Having sacrificed my principles, I was left with the burning question (as it were) of which brand to buy. I had no way to evaluate the virtues of filtered cigarettes versus nonfiltered, or mentholated versus nonmentholated, so I was forced to throw myself on the mercy of the minimart clerk, who appeared to be fourteen years old\u2014too young to",

            "Sunday, I made another trip to the beach, my Grabber Blue Mustang attracting the usual curious stares. If my homeless friends wanted to duck me, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to do. I drove at a speed so slow it made other drivers honk. I passed the recreation center and followed the wide curve that skirted the lagoon that served as a bird refuge. I knew Pete Wolinsky had been shot to death somewhere along here, but it seemed ghoulish to park and search out the spot.",
            "I rolled through the small parking lot along the water\u2019s edge and drove back the way I\u2019d come, scanning both sides of the road. This was clearly unproductive, so I shifted to Plan B. At Milagro, I turned right and drove to the homeless shelter. Harbor House was situated in the middle of the block. The lot is narrow, the building itself set back from the street. There were eight parking spaces in front, all of them in use. A metal accordion gate had been pulled across the front door and secured with a padlock. A hand-lettered sign pasted on a side window said NA SUPPORT GROUP MEETS MONDAY AT 2:00.",
            "While Narcotics Anonymous might not meet on weekends, surely the shelter itself was open. I backed up six steps and peered in both directions. To the right of the building, a heavy-duty fence prevented passage. To the left, a double-wide drive ran between Harbor House and the service station next door. I followed the asphalt path. Tucked between the building and the drive, a stucco arch opened onto a courtyard where a small group of men and women had gathered to smoke. Landscaping was an afterthought: two palms, a few shrubs, and random patches of grass. Sand-filled coffee cans did double duty as receptacles for cigarette butts and freshly hawked-up goobers. Though I felt out of place, what worked to my advantage was that in turtleneck, jeans, and scuffed boots I looked like everyone else.",
            "A metal folding chair was planted in the archway, but no one manned the entrance and no one took notice as I crossed the patio to a door that stood open to the air. I went in, wondering if I\u2019d be asked about my reasons for being on the premises. Being rule governed, I operate in a world filled with imaginary restraints. I\u2019m happiest when signs are posted\u2014NO SPITTING, NO PUBLIC URINATION, NO WALKING ON THE GRASS. I might not obey but at least I knew where I stood.",
            "For the record, I should say this: I don\u2019t romanticize the plight of the homeless or project sentiment where none is required. My take on the indigent is that some are there because of temporary setbacks, some by default, and some for lack of an alternative. Some are needy, some are off their meds, some have opted out, some have been ousted from facilities where they might be better served. Many are there for life and not always by personal choice. Alcoholic, addicted, aimless, illiterate, unmotivated, unskilled, or otherwise unable to prosper, they sink to the bottom, and if they\u2019re down for any length of time, they lose the capacity to climb back out of the hole into which they\u2019ve fallen. If there\u2019s a remedy, I don\u2019t know what it is. From what I\u2019ve seen of the problem, most solutions perpetuate the status quo.",
            "The room I entered was large, furnished with an assortment of couches and chairs, many occupied. The foot traffic in and out was constant. A handsome gentleman in his midsixties was perched on a rolling chair behind the counter to my right. There was a woman ahead of me in this two-person line and I waited my turn. She removed a laminated card from her jeans pocket. By shifting slightly, I saw that it bore her name, an ID number, and a photo likeness.",
            "She pushed the card across the counter. \u201cHi, Ken. Could you check to see if I have mail?\u201d",
            "She leaned on the counter and peered over the edge. On the desktop below there was a ceramic mug full of toothbrushes, still sealed in cellophane packaging. \u201cCan I have one of those?\u201d",
            "By way of reply, he held up the mug and watched as she selected a red toothbrush and put it in her fanny pack. He said, \u201cI heard you were sick. Feeling better?\u201d",
            "She made a face. \u201cI was in the hospital two days. I passed a kidney stone\u2014little bitty thing about the size of a grain of sand\u2014and I\u2019m puking my guts out and shrieking like a banshee. The ER doc thinks I\u2019m faking to score a few Vicodin and that pissed me off. I raised a stink until the other doc signed an order to have me admitted. I finally got a shot of Demerol, no thanks to the asshole who turned me down.\u201d",

            "Ken turned his attention to me. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d",
            "I toyed with the notion of a ruse, but I couldn\u2019t see the point. \u201cI\u2019m looking for information about a fellow named Terrence. I don\u2019t have his last name, but I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll know who I mean. He died a couple of days ago.\u201d",

            "I circled the common room, which was spacious enough to accommodate the twenty-five people present without any suggestion of crowding. There was a big television set in one corner, but the screen was dark. There was a lone bookcase in evidence, the shelves lined side to side with an ancient-looking set of encyclopedias. One fellow had commandeered a couch for napping purposes, and he was curled up with a jacket over him. There were a few ongoing conversations, but in the main people weren\u2019t doing much. An exception was the two women who sat at either end of a Naugahyde couch with knitting projects. One unraveled row after row of a pink sweater, which shrank in her hands, reduced to a lap full of kinked yarn. The other woman struggled with size-19 needles and a ball of thick green wool. The article she was knitting was impossible to identify, something with bumps and irregular edges and holes where stitches had gotten away from her. I don\u2019t knit often these days, but I\u2019m acquainted with the perils. The same aunt who browbeat me into memorizing the rivers of the world by length (the Nile, the Amazon, the Yangtze, the Mississippi-Missouri, the Yenisey, the Yellow, on and on) also taught me to knit and crochet\u2014not for the pleasure of it, but with the intent to promote patience.

Armed with a first name and a description of the deceased, he might track down a doctor who could fill in the blanks. \u201cA bum named Terrence with a bad limp\u201d was hardly definitive, but it was a step in the right direction.

I could have taken the opportunity to detail the scanty facts I\u2019d picked up, but I was hoping for a pat on the head for my resourcefulness. I spent most of the day puttering around the office, feeling distracted and oddly out of sorts. I left early, arriving home at 4:15 instead of the usual 5:00 P.M. I passed Rosie\u2019s twice in my search for a parking place and noted the building was now draped in enormous rectangular tarpaulins that were clipped together along the edges. The red, white, and turquoise stripes gave the place the look of a circus big top. I parked the car around the corner on Bay in the only semi-legal spot I could find.",

His face was smudged with dirt, his white hair dampened by sweat, and his shins flecked with mud. His nose and cheeks were rosy from the autumn sunshine. He\u2019d apparently spent the past couple of hours aerating the lawn in preparation for overseeding the grass. Some sections he\u2019d attacked with a rototiller, then leveled the ground with a weighted roller he\u2019d rented for the occasion. A scoop of fine lawn mulch had been piled to one side with a shovel resting against the wall.",

The unit boasted a zinc top and two drawers where he kept his gardening gloves and the smaller of his gardening tools. On the shelf below he\u2019d placed his galvanized watering cans and a big bag of sphagnum moss. The adjacent wall was designated for the larger tools\u2014his wood-handled garden forks, trowels, cultivators, and graduating sizes of pruning shears. Painted outlines assured that each piece would be returned to its proper place.",
            "Along with his other fall projects, he was transplanting three dozen marigolds from the original plastic commercial nursery containers to terra-cotta pots. He\u2019d already lined my modest porchlet with half a dozen of these rust-and-gold arrangements, which I thought quite festive.",

While Henry returned two pieces of lawn equipment to the garage, I spread the binder open on my lap and studied the list of items he\u2019d checked off. He\u2019d emptied, scoured, and refilled the bird feeders; harvested the last of the summer herbs for drying; pulled faded annuals from flower beds; and transplanted his perennials. He\u2019d also scrubbed and hosed off the outdoor furniture, which was currently air-drying before he stacked it in the storage shed until spring.",

He said it was fortunate he\u2019d taken his cane along though it was barely adequate given the extent of his disability. He\u2019s had to borrow Nell\u2019s walker so he can hobble from place to place. He thought Rosie should rush him to the nearest emergency room, but she was busy fixing dinner, so she made Charlie take him instead. The good news\u2014or the bad, depending on your point of view\u2014is the doctor suggested an MRI and William\u2019s decided to have it done here. He says he\u2019s in dire need of a nerve specialist and asked me to set up an appointment.\u201d",

The pint-size structure was done in the usual Spanish style\u2014a stucco exterior, a red tile roof, and a blaze of magenta bougainvillea artfully draped across the entranceway. Boarding and deplaning were accomplished on foot by way of a rolling set of stairs. Baggage claim was located outside the building in what looked like an extensive temporary carport.",
            "I pulled into the parking lot at 4:59 P.M. just as a United flight was trundling along the runway toward Gate 4. It was a small commuter craft, one of the no-frills short hops where the best one could hope for in the way of food-and-beverage service is a box containing two small pieces of Chiclets chewing gum. The flight attendant would offer the gum in a wicker basket and you were welcome to help yourself as long as you took only one. I was in no particular rush, thinking William would be last off the plane, hampered by his painful, possibly life-threatening condition.",
            "I passed through the ticketing area and out the French doors into the small grassy courtyard. I took my place near the chest-high stucco wall and watched through the length of window glass along the top as a uniformed gate agent pushed a wheelchair toward the prop jet. The engines shut down. Stairs were rolled into place. After a brief delay, the door was wrenched open, and William appeared, his cane hooked over his arm. The natural eddies of air along the runway ruffled his white hair and tugged at his suit coat. A stewardess followed in his wake, supporting him gently by the elbow as he came down the stairs. He didn\u2019t actually smack her hand, but he was visibly offended by the gesture, and he jerked his arm free. He was properly attired for travel in the same dark three-piece suit he wore for funerals and visitations. He took his time, descending the portable stairs like a toddler, first one foot down and joined by the other before he undertook the next. The remaining passengers crowded against the doorway, trying to determine what the traffic jam was about. William was not to be hurried. He was an elegant gentleman, with the same lean frame Henry had been graced with. When he reached the tarmac, he turned and waited at the foot of the stairs, leaning on his cane while the other passengers pushed past him, giving him cross looks.",
            "The pilot appeared next, carrying a bulky red canvas duffel bag with a mesh panel on each end. Behind the pilot, the copilot, or possibly the flight engineer, stepped out of the plane toting William\u2019s black rolling suitcase. Somehow he\u2019d not only claimed the right to deplane first, but he\u2019d enlisted the assistance of the entire crew. They\u2019d probably jumped at the chance to be shed of him. Whatever the motivation, William seemed to take the personal ministrations for granted.",
            "As far as I could tell, he was fine\u2014ambulatory at any rate. He had the pilot place the canvas duffel in the wheelchair, which he manned himself, pushing it toward the terminal. When he caught sight of me, he winced and placed a hand at the small of his back as though stricken with sharp pain. The copilot/flight engineer extended the handle on William\u2019s suitcase and tagged after him dutifully, pulling it along behind. As William and his merry band approached the terminal, I moved out to meet them and took over responsibility for the suitcase, murmuring my thanks to the crew.",
            "William paused and leaned his weight on the handles of the wheelchair. \u201cLet me catch my breath,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough trip. Three stops and just as many changes of aircraft.\u201d",

I grabbed the satchel by the handle and lifted it from the seat of the wheelchair. It was heavier than I\u2019d anticipated and the contents shifted as though he\u2019d packed a bowling ball without securing it properly. I said, \u201cWhoa! What have you got in here?\u201d",
            "I set it down and leaned over so I could peer through the mesh. A hissing white cat, topped with patches of caramel and black, put its ears back and spat. I jerked away, my heart hammering. This cat was the equivalent of the one in horror movies, jumping out when you\u2019re expecting the guy with the bloody butcher knife. \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d I asked, patting my chest.",
            "\u201cI brought the cat,\u201d he said complacently. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to leave it behind. Lewis was going to take it to the pound.\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Talk about a cranky beast.\u201d",
            "\u201cNot as cranky as it would have been if I hadn\u2019t prevailed. I wanted to have the cat with me in the cabin, but the ticket agent refused. I knew there\u2019d be room under the seat in front of me, but she said it was the cargo hold or nothing. Her supervisor was just as argumentative until I mentioned my attorney.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy do you have a cat at all?\u201d",
            "\u201cThis is the stray Charlie took in months ago. Lewis has been opposed all along, which just goes to show what a heartless fellow he is.\u201d",
            "I said, \u201cAh. This is the cat Nell toppled over when she broke her hip.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, yes, but it wasn\u2019t the",
            "cat\u2019s",
            "fault. Even Nell admitted she should have watched where she was stepping.\u201d",
            "William scratched affectionately on the top of the canvas duffel, which caused the cat to rocket around the interior and then ricochet from end to end. \u201cVery playful,\u201d he remarked.",
            "The cat began to claw at the side of the carrier so vigorously, the zipper inched down a hair. I\u2019d have tugged it back into place but I didn\u2019t dare put my hand anywhere near the carrier. I didn\u2019t think the cat could reach me with its claws, but I wasn\u2019t sure the cat knew that.",
            "I returned the carrier to the wheelchair and pushed it as far as the entrance. In no way was I going to tote the cat through the parking lot to the car. I left William on a bench outside, the duffel at his feet, while I retrieved the Mustang, paid the parking fee, and brought it around to the front. William leaned over and said something to the cat, then jumped back as I had. He was apparently so caught up in the cat\u2019s playful antics that he\u2019d forgotten about his infirmity. I put his rolling bag in the trunk and wedged the cat carrier into the space behind the driver\u2019s seat while William took his place in the front, wincing in pain.",
            "\u201cAre you all right?\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t mind me.\u201d",
            "I put the car in gear and eased away from the curb. I hadn\u2019t driven ten feet before the cat let out a long continuous howl, its tone moving up and down the scale as though yodeling. \u201cDoes it always do that?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh no. Just in the car on the way to the airport and all three flights. Airline passengers can be very unpleasant when things don\u2019t go their way. The woman in front of me had a horrid little girl who screamed and cried the whole time, but did anyone complain about that? No, sir.\u201d",
            "\u201cIs it male or female?\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I think you\u2019re supposed to peek at something underneath, but the cat doesn\u2019t care for the idea. Charlie would know. He took it to the vet.\u201d",
            "\u201cDoes it have a name? Joe? Sally? That might be a clue.\u201d",
            "\u201cWe referred to the cat as \u2018the cat.\u2019 I\u2019m sure Nell or Charlie would have come up with a name, but Lewis kept threatening to toss it out and neither of them wanted to get attached. If you think about it, I saved its life, a selfless act on my part.\u201d",
            "\u201cGood for you,\u201d I said. \u201cI must say I\u2019m surprised Rosie agreed to go along with the plan. Where are you going to keep it?\u201d",
            "William and Rosie occupied a two-bedroom apartment above the tavern. I\u2019d never actually seen the place, but Henry assures me the rooms are small and dark and crowded with oversize furniture.",
            "William said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s not for me. I thought Henry would enjoy the companionship.\u201d",
            "\u201cDoes Henry know about this?\u201d",

            "\u201cYou think that\u2019s a problem?\u201d",
            "\u201cFar be it from me to say.\u201d",
            "We drove for a while in silence except for the cat, which was now growling and making relentless work of canvas scratching in between thumps and flinging itself from side to side. I was trying to visualize Henry\u2019s reaction, which I knew would be genuine and heartfelt and probably high pitched. I\u2019ve never lived with a cat myself, but I\u2019d always assumed there was paraphernalia involved. I looked over at William, saying, \u201cWhat about a litter box? Isn\u2019t that where cats do their business?\u201d",
            "He blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary, do you think? Nell let it out in the backyard.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut we live on a busy street. The cat will get hit by a car. Henry\u2019s going to have enough adjustments to make without the cat doing caca on his couch.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou may have a point. We better stop at the market. You can go in while I mind the cat.\u201d",
            "I think it was occurring to William that his plan was ill advised because his back problem seemed to take a sudden turn for the worse. He emitted a short yelp and sucked air through his teeth.",
            "\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to drop you at the house and come back?\u201d The minute I suggested it I knew William would be too smart to introduce the cat without someone else close at hand. Henry would tone down his response if I was present.",
            "\u201cThe pain comes and goes. Sometimes it\u2019s no more than a mild tingling or dull ache. Sometimes a burning sensation. The urgent-care doctor said it could be due to a slipped disc or spinal stenosis. I\u2019ll have to have",
            "tests",
            ".\u201d",
            "\u201cYou poor thing,\u201d I said. To William, a \u201ctest\u201d was the prelude to a terminal diagnosis.",
            "I left the 101 at Capillo and took surface streets in a zigzag detour to the nearest market. I left the howling cat in the car while William limped to and fro in the parking lot, flicking pitiful looks in my direction.",
            "I went into the store and wandered up and down the aisle devoted to pets, throwing items in my cart. The litter box was an easy choice, but there were five or six kinds of litter, and I had no idea what cats preferred in the way of toilet soil. I finally picked the one with the four cute kittens on the package. I threw in a bag of dry food with only the briefest of debates about chicken versus tuna flavors. Then I bought ten small cans of wet food, choosing items I thought I\u2019d like if I were in the cat\u2019s place, only not as hostile. I nearly stopped at the pay phone to call Henry, but he\u2019d probably assume I was playing a practical joke.",
            "Thus it was that I searched out a parking space for the second time that afternoon, this one three doors down from my studio. I put myself in charge of William\u2019s rolling bag and I even went so far as to remove the cat carrier from the backseat, lugging it in one hand as I maneuvered the rolling suitcase with the other. William held open the gate and then trailed along behind me most reluctantly, I thought. I carried the duffel as far as Henry\u2019s back door and set it down.",
            "\u201cYou can do the honors,\u201d I said. When I looked back at William, he was bent double, staring at the walk as though searching for a lost dime.",
            "\u201cBack\u2019s out,\u201d he said.",
            "Henry opened the kitchen door. \u201cGood heavens,\u201d he said as he moved to William\u2019s side. Between us, we helped him up the few shallow steps and into the kitchen. Moaning, William sank into Henry\u2019s rocking chair. I went back for the suitcase and that\u2019s when I saw the cat\u2019s paw appear through a gap where it had worked the zipper down.",
            "I\u2019ve never been present in a delivery room in the tender moment when a child is born, but I picture it much like this. The slit was no more than an inch long when the cat began to push through the opening. After the first paw, its head emerged and shortly after that, one shoulder, followed by a second white paw with a very long front leg attached. Cats are amazingly agile, as was plain to see. I watched, hypnotized, as though witnessing a miracle. \u201cHey, William?\u201d I said, but by then, the cat had wiggled free and streaked off toward the shrubs.",
            "Henry snapped to attention. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d",
            "Weakly, William said, \u201cSurprise!\u201d",
            "4",
            "Tuesday morning I rolled out of bed at 6:00, brushed my teeth, and pulled on my sweats and running shoes. A baseball cap eliminated the need to deal with my hair, which was flat on one side and standing straight out on the other. When I left the house, the only hint that the cat was still in the vicinity was a pair of mouse feet and a long gray tail on my welcome mat. I tied my key into the laces of one shoe and set out at a slow clip, hoping to warm up before I began to jog in earnest.",
            "Henry\u2019s dinner invitation from the night before had been superseded by our efforts to persuade the cat to come out of the bushes. Since William was incapacitated, it fell to Henry and me to crawl around on the newly aerated lawn, coaxing the cat with kitty treats and threats, all to no avail. Once it got dark, we\u2019d been forced to abandon the attempt and hope that the cat would at least remain where it was until morning.",
            "The day promised to be warm. In typical California fashion, the damp and chill of the week before had been replaced by temperatures slated to reach the low eighties. A lingering marine layer hovered like thick white batting, but that would burn off by midday. As though in proof of this, a column of bright yellow sunshine illuminated the ocean just offshore, looking as though a monster hole had been punched in the clouds.",
            "I completed the three-mile loop and slowed to a walk. I hadn\u2019t seen my homeless pals and I wondered how many times the notion of their whereabouts would cross my mind. It was like having a tune lodged in my head, endless replays of a melody I couldn\u2019t seem to block. The week before I\u2019d known nothing of the dead man and nothing of his friends. Now I was troubled by their absence. In deciding to dismiss the matter, I\u2019d succeeded only in tempering its effect. Terrence still hovered on the periphery while I waited for someone to step forward with a few concrete facts. I suppose I\u2019d assumed that once I knew what his story was, I could forget about him entirely and his cronies along with him.",
            "Home again, I showered, dressed, ate my cereal, and read the paper. When I left the studio, there was still no sign of Henry, William, or the cat. Either Henry had lured it inside or it had remained stubbornly out of reach. I left the mouse parts where they were in case the cat was looking forward to a snack later in the day. I hadn\u2019t even known we had mice on the property and now the population was down by one.",
            "Driving to the office, I spotted a pedestrian in a familiar herringbone sport coat poised to cross the street half a block ahead. He gave a quick look in each direction and then fixed his gaze on the sidewalk as he stepped up on the curb, heading in the same direction I was. I slowed and peered closely. Apparently, Fate wasn\u2019t done with me because sure enough, it was Dandy in baggy black trousers and a pair of bright white running shoes. I pulled over to the curb and rolled down the car window on the passenger side. \u201cDandy? It\u2019s Kinsey. You want a ride?\u201d",
            "He smiled when he caught sight of me. \u201cThat\u2019d be nice. I was on my way to your office.\u201d",
            "\u201cHop in and I\u2019ll deliver you to my door.\u201d",
            "I flipped the locks. Dandy opened the car door and slid into the passenger seat, bringing with him the cloudy smell of old cigarettes, which seemed to cling to his clothes. His pale pink dress shirt was freshly ironed and had the stiffness and sheen of spray starch. I had to guess he\u2019d spiffed himself up in anticipation of the visit. I could smell soap and shampoo and the saturated scent of alcohol wafting through his skin. It was an odd combination; his efforts at personal hygiene undercut by his habitual intake of whiskey and nicotine. I experienced a piercing sense of protectiveness because he seemed so unaware of his effect.",
            "He held up my business card. \u201cI never met a private eye, so I thought I better see for myself.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe office isn\u2019t much, but you can be the judge. I take it Pearl wasn\u2019t panting to see me again.\u201d",
            "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like to walk. Me, I hoof it all over town. I apologize for her being rude the other day.\u201d",
            "\u201cIs she always that hostile?\u201d",
            "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t fret if I were you. It\u2019s nothing personal. Terrence was a good friend and his death was a blow. She hasn\u2019t been handling it well.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy take it out on me? I didn\u2019t even know the man.\u201d",
            "\u201cShe\u2019s disputatious, though she\u2019s not as tough as she\u2019d have us believe. She may give you a hard time, but she\u2019s a pussycat at heart.\u201d",
            "\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d",
            "I took a right turn off Santa Teresa Street onto Caballero Lane, which was one block long. My office was the center one in a line of three small stucco cottages. In addition to the cheap rent, the location was close to the heart of downtown, in walking distance of the public library, the courthouse, and the police station. I pulled up in front. There were ample parking spots available because the bungalows on either side of me were empty and had been since I moved in. Dandy got out and waited while I locked the car and joined him on the walk. He had a courtly air about him. Maybe it was the dress shirt or the hint of humor in his eyes. I thought he seemed surprisingly intelligent, and then I had to stop and correct myself. Being homeless and being smart aren\u2019t mutually exclusive states. There might be any number of reasons he was on the street.",
            "I led the way up the front steps. I unlocked the door and opened it for him. \u201cI\u2019m putting on a pot of coffee if you\u2019re interested.\u201d",

            "I rinsed out the coffeepot and slotted it onto the machine, putting a fresh filter in the holder, which I popped into place. Over my shoulder, I could see Dandy in the outer office, where he browsed the various law books and texts in my collection, everything from",
            "California Criminal Law",
            "to a 1980 edition of the",

            "When he drifted into the inner office, I left the coffee brewing in the kitchenette and joined him. It crossed my mind, just briefly, that he might try pilfering an item, but then I remembered I didn\u2019t have anything of value. No cash, no dope, no prescription medication, and no bottle of booze in my bottom drawer. If he wanted a ballpoint pen, I\u2019d be happy to gift him with one.",
            "He\u2019d taken a seat in one of the two guest chairs, clearly curious about my domain. I took my place on the other side of the desk and tried seeing the place through his eyes. As it happens, my office is devoid of personal touches. I have an artificial ficus tree that I think lends the room a hint of class, but the fake plant is about it. There are no family photographs, no travel posters, no bric-a-brac, and no paperweight advertising \u201cBail Bonds, Quick Response.\u201d For the most part, my desktop was clear, all of the paperwork consigned to folders tucked away in the file cabinets lining one wall.",

Slightly off, I thought, but I\u2019ve heard that sometimes the residue of milk on the pour spout sours before the rest. I filled two mugs with coffee and added milk to mine, checking for the telltale curdling that suggests beaucoup bacteria at work. No evidence of spoilage, so I added a big dollop to his coffee and returned the carton to the fridge.",

The two were close when he was a kid, but he hadn\u2019t seen the man for years. Said he came to visit his uncle here shortly after the man moved to Santa Teresa. Later he heard the fellow died.

He didn\u2019t like to talk about it. He slept a couple of nights under a freeway overpass and figured out it was a bad idea. The panhandlers with cardboard signs aren\u2019t as nice as the rest of us. You stand by the road begging, that\u2019s a different work ethic. Terrence tried the Rescue Mission, but they wouldn\u2019t take him unless he swore off alcohol, which he wasn\u2019t about to do. He heard about the shelter and when he showed up, the first person he met was Pearl. She introduced him to Felix and me. Harbor House, you don\u2019t have to be sober, but you\u2019d better not be obstreperous. Make trouble and you\u2019re out.\u201d",

            "\u201cOh, he had a card. I\u2019m sure of it. Harbor House issued one so he could take his meals with us. Someone walked off with all his stuff, so maybe it was in his cart.\u201d",

            "\u201cNot him. He didn\u2019t want a bed. Nights, he didn\u2019t like to be around other folks. He spent most his time drunk and he hung out with another fellow in the same sorry shape. Now and then he tried cleaning up his act without much success.\u201d",
            "\u201cSo he was in Santa Teresa, what, eight or nine months?\u201d",
            "\u201cSounds about right. He loved it here. He said he was never going anyplace else. March, the other fellow died and Terrence went on a bender that landed him in jail. After that he sobered up for a couple weeks. Then he started in again and one day collapsed in the street. He was lucky he didn\u2019t die that round. Pain meds and alcohol are a bad mix.\u201d",

            "POSTMORTEM The first Dr Kay Scarpetta novel which won five international awards for the best first crime novel of 1990. 'Terrific first novel, full of suspense, in which even the scientific bits grip.' The Times ALL THAT REMAINS A killer is stalking young lovers. Taking their lives and leaving just one tantalising clue . 'Another triumph for Patricia Cornwell's special brew of forensic and intuitive sleuthing.' Sunday Times Visit Patricia Cornwell's own website at www.patricia- cornwell.com",
            "From Publishers Weekly",
            "Cornwell, a former reporter who has worked in a medical examiner's office, sets her first mystery in Richmond, Va. Chief medical officer for the commonwealth of Virginia, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, the narrator, dwells on her efforts to identify \"Mr. Nobody,\" the strangler of young women. The doctor devotes days and nights to gathering computer data and forensic clues to the killer, although she's hampered by male officials anxious to prove themselves superior to a woman. Predictably, Scarpetta's toil pays off, but not before the strangler attacks her; a reformed male chauvinist, conveniently nearby, saves her. Although readers may be naturally disposed to admire Scarpetta and find the novel's scientific aspect interesting, they are likely to be put off by her self-aggrandizement and interminable complaints, annoying flaws in an otherwise promising debut.

            "From Library Journal",
            "This award-winning novel based on Richmond's real-life \"South Side Strangler\" case introduced Virginia's chief medical examiner, Kay Scarpetta, and launched Cornwell's career. Narrator Lorelei King generally has a pleasant reading voice and uses good pacing to build suspense. However, this is not a successful merger of book and reader for American ears. Listeners may be confused to hear that Kay wears \"cocky\" (khaki), for instance, and accenting the second syllable of such words as modem and condom distract the listener from the story. Furthermore, the voices of supporting characters (such as Marino, a \"stoopid\" New Jersey cop, and Lucy, a fussy Southern child) are stereotypical. Fortunately, an unabridged version of Postmortem is available from several other producers, including Recorded Books (Audio Reviews, LJ 2/15/94).

            "It\u2019s been said many times and many ways, but there\u2019s no place like home. A whirlwind three-year journey brought two-time GRAMMY Award-nominated songstress Lauren Daigle right back to her native Louisiana in 2017. Jumpstarted by her platinum-certified 2015 full-length debut How Can It Be, the road twisted and turned at light speed. Along the way, she gathered three Billboard Music Awards, notched an American Music Awards nomination, earned gold certifications for three singles and three K-LOVE Fan Awards. Additionally, she sold out headline tours, contributed an original composition to the critically acclaimed Blade Runner: 2049 soundtrack and touring relentlessly. The sights and sounds of her birthplace stoked this energy. Cherishing memories of attending Lafayette\u2019s Festival International every year throughout her childhood, she opened up to the gritty, organic, and handmade sounds associated with Louisiana\u2019s legendary scene. Hitting the studio with frequent collaborators Jason Ingram and Paul Mabury behind the board, she commenced work on what would become her second full-length album, Look Up Child. Track List: 1. Still Rolling Stones 2. Rescue 3. This Girl 4. Your Wings 5. You Say 6. Everything 7. Love Like This 8. Look Up Child 9. Losing My Religion 10. Remember 11. Rebel Heart 12. Inevitable 13.

            "Talk about a Collector's Edition. This one's got it all. First, a CD of the original album, remastered with bonus tracks. Next, another CD of the first live session performed by the group (May 26, 1958), plus The Den Haag Concert and The Zurich Concert (over 60 minutes of music). Then, a DVD featuring an expanded Making Of Kind Of Blue documentary, as well as the historic television program The Sound Of Miles Davis, filmed in 1959. And finally, a premium, 180-gram BLUE vinyl companion record. Plus, a hardcover book with additional memorabilia. Originally recorded in 1959, Kind Of Blue is widely regarded as the definitive jazz album, a universally acknowledged standard of excellence. It is also the best-selling jazz album of all time. Representing the pinnacle of modal jazz, Miles Davis brought together John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb and assembled one of the greatest bands in history, spontaneously inventing a new musical style and language in the process.

            "Spieldauer: 7 Stunden und 27 MinutenHape Kerkeling, aus der Kirche ausgetretener Komiker, K\u00f6nigin-Beatrix- und Horst-Schl\u00e4mmer-Parodist, Schauspieler und (Let's Dance)-Moderator, und der Jakobsweg, einer der wichtigsten Pilgerpfade \u00fcberhaupt -- passt das zusammen? Auf den ersten Blick nicht wirklich. Kerkeling hat selbst seine Zweifel, als er sich in den Pyren\u00e4en mit seinem elf Kilo schweren Rucksack Kehre f\u00fcr Kehre in Richtung fernes Saniago de Compostela dahinschleppt. Doch im Lauf der rund 800 Kilometer langen Tour schwinden die Zweifel, sowohl beim Autor als auch beim Leser. Die beiden passen, und wie.",
            "Der Jakobsweg ist seit knapp tausend Jahren Gegenstand unz\u00e4hliger Aufzeichnungen und B\u00fccher, gerade in den vergangenen Jahren gab es eine wahre Flut zu diesem Thema. Und doch ist",
            "Ich bin dann mal weg",
            "erfrischend anders, was an der ganz und gar typisch Kerkeling'schen Art und Weise liegt, seine rund sechs Wochen lange Tour am\u00fcsant und beschwingt, aber dennoch ergreifend und sehr pers\u00f6nlich wiederzugeben. Seine ungek\u00fcnstelten Tagebucheintr\u00e4ge machen Mut, dass auch ausgewiesene Couch Potatos die durchaus vorhandenen Strapazen der Wanderung zu meistern. Strapazen lauern \u00fcbrigens auch in Gestalt wenig komfortabler Unterk\u00fcnfte, manch ungenie\u00dfbar scheinender Mahlzeit und aufdringlicher Weggef\u00e4hrten.",
            "Kerkeling nimmt alle H\u00fcrden und dabei kein Blatt vor den Mund. Er beschreibt die Dinge und Menschen, wie sie sind. Demzufolge fungiert das 320 Seiten starke und mit einigen netten Fotos angereicherte Buch als ausgezeichneter und sehr detaillierter Reisef\u00fchrer -- wenngleich sich im Vergleich zum Jahr 2001, in dem dieser Trip stattfand, sicherlich einiges ge\u00e4ndert haben d\u00fcrfte. Wichtiger noch ist aber die Funktion als vom Jakobsweg losgel\u00f6ster spiritueller Ratgeber. Das Gute daran: Das Buch will gar kein spiritueller Ratgeber sein. Missionarischer Eifer, arrogante Besserwisserei, nervige Erleuchtungseskapaden? Fehlanzeige. Und doch geht es viel um Gott, Religion, Wiedergeburt (ein Thema, dass die Boulevardpresse dankbar aufgriff) und die zentrale Frage \u0084Wer bin ich?\u0093 Seine Gedanken bringt Kerkeling in den so genannten \u0084Erkenntnissen des Tages\u0093 auf den Punkt. Kostprobe vom 3. Juli: \u0084Manchmal ist es das Vern\u00fcnftigste, einfach herrlich verr\u00fcckt zu sein!\u0093 Zum Beispiel, als untrainierter Wanderer sechs Wochen lang zu wandern.",

The skill with which he delivers a shock or sense of gothic terror is simply unmatched Independent on Sunday Perfectly balanced: another excellent example of King's sheer skill as a storyteller. Daily Express A frantic-paced puzzle-box adventure that encompasses gunslinger Roland Deschain's early years, werewolves and powerful storytelling. Shortlist King is one of the great popular artists of our time. Independent Like John Steinbeck, he's an unfussy writer whose voice is rooted equally in the rhythms of everyday speech and the mythic made manifest in everyday life. Indeed, reading King, you often sense the presence of the dustbowl America of The Grapes of Wrath ... a King novel has a sparse elegance that most novelists never achieve in a whole career. Put it down to the insistent, economical and wholly distinctive authorial voice.

            "Most of the people holding this book have followed the adventures of Roland and his band\u2014his ka-tet\u2014for years, some of them from the very beginning. Others\u2014and I hope there are many, newcomers and Constant Readers alike\u2014may ask,",

            "story if I haven\u2019t read the other Dark Tower books?",
            "My answer is yes, if you keep a few things in mind.",
            "First, Mid-World lies next to our world, and there are many overlaps. In some places there are doorways between the two worlds, and sometimes there are thin places, porous places, where the two worlds actually mingle. Three of Roland\u2019s ka-tet\u2014Eddie, Susannah, and Jake have been drawn separately from troubled lives in New York into Roland\u2019s Mid-World quest. Their fourth traveling companion, a billy-bumbler named Oy, is a golden-eyed creature native to Mid-World. Mid-World is very old, and falling to ruin, filled with monsters and untrustworthy magic.",
            "Second, Roland Deschain of Gilead is a gunslinger\u2014one of a small band that tries to keep order in an increasingly lawless world. If you think of the gunslingers of Gilead as a strange combination of knights errant and territorial marshals in the Old West, you\u2019ll be close to the mark. Most of them, although not all, are descended from the line of the old White King, known as Arthur Eld (I told you there were overlaps).",
            "Third, Roland has lived his life under a terrible curse. He killed his mother, who was having an affair\u2014mostly against her will, and certainly against her better judgment\u2014with a fellow you will meet in these pages. Although it was by mistake, he holds himself accountable, and the unhappy Gabrielle Deschain\u2019s death has haunted him since his young manhood. These events are fully narrated in the Dark Tower cycle, but for our purposes here, I think it\u2019s all you have to know.",

Its mouth jutted out over the water on pilings painted a similar green. Docked to two of these pilings by thick hawsers was a large raft, easily ninety feet by ninety, painted in alternating stripes of red and yellow. A tall wooden pole that looked like a mast jutted from the center, but there was no sign of a sail. Several wicker chairs sat in front of it, facing the shore on their side of the river. Jake was seated in one of these. Next to him was an old man in a vast straw hat, baggy green pants, and longboots. On his top half he wore a thin white garment\u2014the kind of shirt Roland thought of as a slinkum. Jake and the old man appeared to be eating well-stuffed popkins. Roland\u2019s mouth sprang water at the sight of them.",

So when it's time for her medicine, George concocts a bubbling, frothing, marvellous mixture, which is guaranteed to send her through the roof . . .",

In the first novel, George comes up with a potion to improve the mood of his grumpy grandma; the second centers on the efforts of farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean to catch the titular thief.

As the old woman alternately insults and scares him, George decides to give her a new kind of medicine. Using every liquid, powder, and pill he can find, George makes a concoction destined to change the family and several hens. Richard E. Grant fluidly changes from a good-natured boy pushed too far to the nastiest old lady imaginable to a hyperactive father with a brogue to a sensible mother wanting only peace and quiet.

George decides he will create a medicine to relieve Grandma of all of her awfulness. Adding everything he can find in the house and barn, including shampoo, shaving cream, animal medicines, shoe polish, and paint, George boils up a pot of medicine that has shocking results when given to Grandma. Utter chaos breaks out when his father determines that they should brew up more of the awful stuff to give to the farmyard animals and George can't quite remember exactly what he used the first time around. Derek Jacobi does a commendable job voicing the quirky characters; Grandma is perfectly grating and nasty. The pacing is just right for the wacky presentation, and Jacobi nicely captures the complete pandemonium as things spiral out of control. This is a quick listen and should appeal to fans of Dahl although it may leave some adults feeling squeamish and grateful for the warning to \"not try this at home\" found at the beginning of the presentation.\u2014Deanna Romriell, Salt Lake City Public Library, UT",

            "3:10 to Yuma",
            "leads some moviegoers to check out",
            "Delmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original",
            ". That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.",
            "All of the above applies in the new",
            "3:10",
            ", but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)",
            "Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.",

The quest to find her sister\u2019s killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed - a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae\u2026 As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister\u2019s death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane - an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women - closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac\u2019s true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book - because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands\u2026"

As he shows, it's really the things you love that define who you are and so Graham tells his story from childhood to present day, describing just what and who he loved - and sometimes lost - as a child, and how he has discovered and rediscovered new loves and obsessions - big and small - as he's grown older. From dogs and boys to Dolly Parton and Ireland Graham tells his life and loves with characteristic humour and outrageous candour."

            "Bill Bryson's first travel book, The Lost Continent, was unanimously acclaimed as one of the funniest books in years. In Neither here Nor there he brings his unique brand of humour to bear on Europe as he shoulders his backpack, keeps a tight hold on his wallet, and journeys from Hamemrfest, the northernmost town on the continent, to istanbul on the cusp of Asia. Fluent in, oh, at least one language, he retraces his travels as a student twenty years before. Whether braving the homicidal motorists of Paris, being robbed by gypsies in Florence, attempting not to order tripe and eyeballs in a German restaurant, window-shopping in the sex shops of the Reeperbahn or disputing his hotel bill in Copenhagen, Bryson takes in the sights, dissects the culture and illuminates each place and person with his hilariously caustic observations. He even goes to Liechtenstein."

            "To hear this powerful story read by the woman who lived it is a life-changing experience. Ali survived civil war and mutilation to become an international spokeswoman for Islamic reform, especially with respect to womens rights. Her escape from Saudi Arabia and Somalia to the free-thinking Netherlands is stark in its incomprehensible contrasts and sometimes darkly amusing in its misunderstandings of cultural differences. Ali earned a political science degree and became the first Muslim member of the Dutch parliament. She worked with Theo Van Gogh on the film SUBMISSION before he was assassinated by a fanatical Muslim terrorist who objected to the film. Alis thick accent makes some words unintelligible, but her acuity and vigor counterbalance this to make the listener all the more in awe of her."

            "The long-awaited new novel from Margaret Atwood. The Year of the Flood is a dystopic masterpiece and a testament to her visionary power. The times and species have been changing at a rapid rate, and the social compact is wearing as thin as environmental stability. Adam One, the kindly leader of the God's Gardeners--a religion devoted to the melding of science and religion, as well as the preservation of all plant and animal life--has long predicted a natural disaster that will alter Earth as we know it. Now it has occurred, obliterating most human life. Two women have survived: Ren, a young trapeze dancer locked inside the high-end sex club Scales and Tails, and Toby, a God's Gardener barricaded inside a luxurious spa where many of the treatments are edible. Have others survived? Ren's bioartist friend Amanda? Zeb, her eco-fighter stepfather? Her onetime lover, Jimmy? Or the murderous Painballers, survivors of the mutual-elimination Painball prison? Not to mention the shadowy, corrupt policing force of the ruling powers... Meanwhile, gene-spliced life forms are proliferating: the lion/lamb blends, the Mo'hair sheep with human hair, the pigs with human brain tissue. As Adam One and his intrepid hemp-clad band make their way through this strange new world, Ren and Toby will have to decide on their next move. They can't stay locked away... By turns dark, tender, violent, thoughtful, and uneasily hilarious, The Year of the Flood is Atwood at her most brilliant and inventive."

Remastered in 2011 (Sony Press Japan's First CD). This product was created in 1977. Concept album that painstakingly criticizes social problems while replacing the human world with animals. The pig, which became one of the band icons in the song, flying over the Butter Sea Power Station in London, is a hypnosis. The sound is tighter and more aggressive as if pulled by the extreme content, and the effects of the Waters are even stronger in the band. It was a hit with the second place in the UK and 3rd place in the United States.",

            "The late founder of the Wal-Mart chain describes how he turned a single dime store into the world's largest retail operation. As Sam Walton himself said, this is \"...a story about entrepreneurship, and risk, and hard work, and knowing where you want to go and being willing to do what it takes to get there. And it's a story about believing in your idea even when maybe some other folks don't, and about sticking to your guns.\" It's the story of how Walton parlayed a single dime store in a hardscrabble cotton town into Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world. The undisputed merchant king of the late twentieth century, he never lost the common touch. Here Walton tells his extraordinary story in his own inimitable words. Genuinely modest, but always sure of his ambitions and achievements, Walton shares his thinking in a candid, straight-from-the-shoulder style."

            "Recorded in November 1993, less than six months before singer Kurt Cobain killed himself, Nirvana's MTV Unplugged is a watershed document that presents a band at the peak of its powers. Unlike any other unplugged affair, the diverse album is not a simple stripped-down regurgitation of greatest hits or a cash-it-in set of nostalgic favorites. Rather, the live effort is among the most emotionally naked spectacles ever released an album so starkly intense and profoundly personal, it's impossible not to get chills down the spine. Track List: 1. About A Girl 2. Come as You Are 3. Jesus Doesn't Want Me for A Sunbeam 4. The Man Who Sold the World 5. Pennyroyal Tea 6. Dumb 7. Polly 8. On A Plain 9. Something in The Way 10.

            "Easily The Biggest SACD Title in The Analogue Productions Catalog! A multitrack masterpiece. Mixed for 5.1 surround sound and stereo from the original analog master tapes by Pink Floyd Producer/Engineer James Guthrie One of the biggest SACD reissues in the history of the format \u2014 back in print Wish You Were Here(?) Now you can be. Total lifelike recreation of a chart-topping, pioneering, way-ahead-of-its-time blockbuster. You talk about a title made for multichannel SACD! It's as if they knew at the album's creation that this format would be available. Finally, technology caught up with Pink Floyd. And oh how lucky we all are to still be around to hear this legendary studio recording in its full potential. Pink Floyd chose Acoustic Sounds and Analogue Productions to handle the exclusive distribution of this monumental SACD and we are honored and thrilled to be a part of the huge Why Pink Floyd...? campaign that includes remastered CDs, Blu-rays, DVDs, LPs, memorabilia box sets and this, the first-ever multichannel presentation of Wish You Were Here. The SACD also of course includes a stunning stereo mix. And as this is a hybrid disc, the record is of course also playable on a standard CD player. On its release in 1975 Wish You Were Here topped the album charts in both the U.K. and the U.S. Reflecting the band's thoughts of the time on the music business and exploring themes of absence, Wish You Were Here contains the classic cut \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\" a tribute to founding band member Syd Barrett. In fact, Barrett, who'd long been absent from the lives of Pink Floyd's band members, stopped by the Wish You Were Here recording sessions at London's Abbey Road Studios unannounced. The reunion \u2014 with Barrett reportedly appearing in poor mental condition \u2014 is said to have been an emotionally stirring event for the band, and apparently that encounter would be the last any of the band members were ever to see of Barrett, who died in 2006. As they did with their previous release, Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd made great use of studio effects for this, their ninth album overall. The record's winding soundscapes are perfect for the canvas of multichannel SACD. Spacious and airy, the record breathes like a living being. Wish You Were Here was selected by Rolling Stone as No. 209 on their list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". And that's before they heard it like this! 5.1 surround mix by James Guthrie Assistant engineer Joel Plante Mastered by James Guthrie and Joel Plante Mixed and mastered at das boot recording DSD authoring for SACD by Gus Skinas \"...Analogue Productions got the exclusive for the latter's appearance in 5.1 on SACD. The results are spectacular, given that the progressive rock of the day - this dates from 1975 - was conceived from the outset to immerse the listener in sound. Regardless of its surround sound aspect, this is a dazzling effort...today's discrete multichannel capabilities truly liberate the sound in all of its open and spacious glory.\" Sound Quality: 92% \u2014 Ken Kessler, Hi Fi News, February 2012 \"The Analogue Productions SACD of Wish You Were Here offers a premium quality compact package and the rapturous sound quality of high resolution audio...For Pink Floyd Fans, Wish You Were Here represents the perfect synergy of sonic perfection, lyrical emotion and instrumental proficiency. Deservedly so, Wish You Were Here now joins Dark Side Of The Moon on the Super Audio CD format, offering Pink Floyd fans the quintessential audiophile listening experience. Highly recommended!\" \u2014 Paul Powell Jr., Brain Damage, December 2011"

            "This superb compilation, often called \"the red album\", brings together the majority of the Beatles' hits from the early to mid-60s. Consequently, it plays like an overview of some of the most popular and indelible rock songs of all time. From the \"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\" of \"She Loves You\" through the amped-up giddiness of \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", the minor-key melodicism of \"And I Love Her,\u201d and on to the chiming power pop of \"Eight Days a Week\" and the tweaky feedback of \"I Feel Fine,\u201d these are the songs that turned the entire Western world on its ear. Track List: Disc 1 1. Love Me Do 2. Please Please Me 3. From Me to You 4. She Loves You 5. I Want to Hold Your Hand 6. All My Loving 7. Can't Buy Me Love 8. A Hard Day's Night 9. And I Love Her 10. Eight Days a Week11. I Feel Fine12. Ticket To Ride13. Yesterday Disc 2 1. Help!  2. You've Got to Hide Your Love Away 3. We Can Work It Out 4. Day Tripper 5. Drive My Car 6. Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)  7. Nowhere Man 8. Michelle 9. In My Life 10. Girl11. Paperback Writer12. Eleanor Rigby13. Yellow Submarine"

            "\"The greatest writer of historical adventures today\" (Washington Post) tackles his richest, most thrilling subject yet--the heroic tale of Agincourt. Young Nicholas Hook is dogged by a cursed past--haunted by what he has failed to do and banished for what he has done. A wanted man in England, he is driven to fight as a mercenary archer in France, where he finds two things he can love: his instincts as a fighting man, and a girl in trouble. Together they survive the notorious massacre at Soissons, an event that shocks all Christendom. With no options left, Hook heads home to England, where his capture means certain death. Instead he is discovered by the young King of England--Henry V himself--and by royal command he takes up the longbow again and dons the cross of Saint George. Hook returns to France as part of the superb army Henry leads in his quest to claim the French crown. But after the English campaign suffers devastating early losses, it becomes clear that Hook and his fellow archers are their king's last resort in a desperate fight against an enemy more daunting than they could ever have imagined. One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare in Henry V--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands. Here Bernard Cornwell resurrects the legend of the battle and the \"band of brothers\" who fought it on October 25, 1415. An epic of redemption, Agincourt follows a commoner, a king, and a nation's entire army on an improbable mission to test the will of God and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. From the disasters at the siege of Harfleur to the horrors of the field of Agincourt, this exhilarating story of survival and slaughter is at once a brilliant work of history and a triumph of imagination\u2014Bernard Cornwell at his best."

            "Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our companies, in our communities, and in our own lives? The primary obstacle is a conflict that\u2019s built into our brains, say Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the critically acclaimed bestseller Made to Stick. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems\u2014the rational mind and the emotional mind\u2014that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort\u2014but if it is overcome, change can come quickly. In Switch, the Heaths show how everyday people\u2014employees and managers, parents and nurses\u2014have united both minds and, as a result, achieved dramatic results: \u25cf The lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched, decades-old medical practice that was endangering patients. \u25cf The home-organizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping. \u25cf The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customer-support team into service zealots by removing a standard tool of customer service In a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change. Switch shows that successful changes follow a pattern, a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you, whether your interest is in changing the world or changing your waistline."

But they were enough to forever change rock 'n' roll. Even more shocking is that one of the great bands in rock history, with its last studio album issued 10 years ago, has never had a \"best of\" compilation. Now it has. Welcome to the jungle with Greatest Hits (Geffen), released March 23, 2004. With 14 selections housed in a digipak, Greatest Hits features all eight of the band's Top 40 Billboard Hot 100 tracks (five of them RIAA-certified \"gold,\" i.e., sales of more than 500,000 units). Along with spanning the group's five album releases, Greatest Hits also marks the debut on a Guns N' Roses album of the band's cover of the Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" for the 1995 film Interview with the Vampire.  Track List:  1. Welcome to The Jungle 2. Sweet Child O' Mine 3. Patience 4. Paradise City 5. Knockin' on Heaven's Door 6. Civil War 7. You Could Be Mine 8. Don't Cry Original 9. November Rain 10.

On the one hand, Fantastic Audio's recording presents a rare treat for readers, featuring author LeGuin's performance of the beginning and ending of her book. Unfortunately, narrator Gabrielle de Cuir is a poor match for this wonderful tale. Many of de Cuir's declarative sentences end in a questioning tone, her dialogue is flat, and her characters are difficult to distinguish. Several passages were enhanced by the lightest touch of music. Part of LeGuin's Earthsea Cycle, this book provides the jumping-off point into unknown worlds for many fantasy readers and deserves a more animated reader.

            "One high horn shrilled and ceased. The silence that followed was shaken only by the sound of many footsteps keeping time with a drum struck softly at a slow heart-pace. Through cracks in the roof of the Hall of the Throne, gaps between columns where a whole section of masonry and tile had collapsed, unsteady sunlight shone aslant. It was an hour after sunrise. The air was still and cold. Dead leaves of weeds that had forced up between marble pavement-tiles were outlined with frost, and crackled, catching on the long black robes of the priestesses.",
            "They came, four by four, down the vast hall between double rows of columns. The drum beat dully. No voice spoke, no eye watched. Torches carried by black-clad girls burned reddish in the shafts of sunlight, brighter in the dusk between. Outside, on the steps of the Hall of the Throne, the men stood, guards, trumpeters, drummers; within the great doors only women had come, dark-robed and hooded, walking slowly four by four towards the empty throne.",
            "Two came, tall women looming in their black, one of them thin and rigid, the other heavy, swaying with the planting of her feet. Between these two walked a child of about six. She wore a straight white shift. Her head and arms and legs were bare, and she was barefoot. She looked extremely small. At the foot of the steps leading up to the throne, where the others now waited in dark rows, the two tall women halted. They pushed the child forward a little.",
            "The throne on its high platform seemed to be curtained on each side with great webs of blackness dropping from the gloom of the roof; whether these were curtains, or only denser shadows, the eye could not make certain. The throne itself was black, with a dull glimmer of precious stones or gold on the arms and back, and it was huge. A man sitting in it would have been dwarfed; it was not of human dimensions. It was empty. Nothing sat in it but shadows.",
            "Alone, the child climbed up four of the seven steps of red-veined marble. They were so broad and high that she had to get both feet onto one step before attempting the next. On the middle step, directly in front of the throne, stood a large, rough block of wood, hollowed out on top. The child knelt on both knees and fitted her head into the hollow, turning it a little sideways. She knelt there without moving.",
            "A figure in a belted gown of white wool stepped suddenly out of the shadows at the right of the throne and strode down the steps to the child. His face was masked with white. He held a sword of polished steel five feet long. Without word or hesitation he swung the sword, held in both hands, up over the little girl's neck. The drum stopped beating.",
            "As the blade swung to its highest point and poised, a figure in black darted out from the left side of the throne, leapt down the stairs, and stayed the sacrificer's arms with slenderer arms. The sharp edge of the sword glittered in mid-air. So they balanced for a moment, the white figure and the black, both faceless, dancer-like above the motionless child whose white neck was bared by the parting of her black hair.",
            "In silence each leapt aside and up the stairs again, vanishing in the darkness behind the enormous throne. A priestess came forward and poured out a bowl of liquid on the steps beside the kneeling child. The stain looked black in the dimness of the hall.",
            "The child got up and descended the four stairs laboriously. When she stood at the bottom, the two tall priestesses put on her a black robe and hood and mantle, and turned her around again to face the steps, the dark stain, the throne.",
            "\"O let the Nameless Ones behold the girl given to them, who is verily the one born ever nameless. Let them accept her life and the years of her life until her death, which is also theirs. Let them find her acceptable. Let her be eaten!\"",
            "Other voices, shrill and harsh as trumpets, replied: \"She is eaten! She is eaten!\"",
            "The little girl stood looking from under her black cowl up at the throne. The jewels inset in the huge clawed arms and the back were glazed with dust, and on the carven back were cobwebs and whitish stains of owl droppings. The three highest steps directly before the throne, above the step on which she had knelt, had never been climbed by mortal feet. They were so thick with dust that they looked like one slant of gray soil, the planes of the red-veined marble wholly hidden by the unstirred, untrodden siftings of how many years, how many centuries.",
            "\"She is eaten! She is eaten!\"",
            "Now the drum, abrupt, began to sound again, beating a quicker pace.",
            "Silent and shuffling, the procession formed and moved away from the throne, eastward towards the bright, distant square of the doorway. On either side, the thin double columns, like the calves of immense pale legs, went up to the dusk under the ceiling. Among the priestesses, and now all in black like them, the child walked, her small bare feet treading solemnly over the frozen weeds, the icy stones. When sunlight slanting through the ruined roof flashed across her way, she did not look up.",
            "Guards held the great doors wide. The black procession came out into the thin, cold light and wind of early morning. The sun dazzled, swimming above the eastern vastness. Westward, the mountains caught its yellow light, as did the fa\u00c7ade of the Hall of the Throne. The other buildings, lower on the hill, still lay in purplish shadow, except for the Temple of the God-Brothers across the way on a little knoll: its roof, newly gilt, flashed the day back in glory. The black line of the priestesses, four by four, wound down the Hill of the Tombs, and as they went they began softly to chant. The tune was on three notes only, and the word that was repeated over and over was a word so old it had lost its meaning, like a signpost still standing when the road is gone. Over and over they chanted the empty word. All that day of the Remaking of the Priestess was filled with the low chanting of women's voices, a dry unceasing drone.",
            "The little girl was taken from room to room, from temple to temple. In one place salt was placed upon her tongue; in another she knelt facing west while her hair was cut short and washed with oil and scented vinegar; in another she lay face down on a slab of black marble behind an altar while shrill voices sang a lament for the dead. Neither she nor any of the priestesses ate food or drank water all that day. As the evening star set, the little girl was put to bed, naked between sheepskin rugs, in a room she had never slept in before. It was in a house that had been locked for years, unlocked only that day. The room was higher than it was long, and had no windows. There was a dead smell in its, still and stale. The silent women left her there in the dark.",
            "She held still, lying just as they had put her. Her eyes were wide open. She lay so for a long time.",
            "She saw light shake on the high wall. Someone came quietly along the corridor, shielding a rushlight so it showed no more light than a firefly. A husky whisper: \"Ho, are you there, Tenar?\"",
            "The child did not reply.",
            "A head poked in the doorway, a strange head, hairless as a peeled potato, and of the same yellowish color. The eyes were like potato-eyes, brown and tiny. The nose was dwarfed by great, flat slabs of cheek, and the mouth was a lipless slit. The child stared unmoving at this face. Her eyes were large, dark, fixed.",
            "\"Ho, Tenar, my little honeycomb, there you are!\" The voice was husky, high as a woman's voice but not a woman's voice. \"I shouldn't be here, I belong outside the door, on the porch, that's where I go. But I had to see how my little Tenar is, after all the long day of it, eh, how's my poor little honeycomb?\"",
            "He moved towards her, noiseless and burly, and put out his hand as if to smooth back her hair.",
            "\"I am not Tenar any more,\" the child said, staring up at him. His hand stopped; he did not touch her.",
            "\"No,\" he said, after a moment, whispering. \"I know. I know. Now you're the little Eaten One. But I\u0160\"",
            "She said nothing.",
            "\"It was a hard day for a little one,\" the man said, shuffling the tiny light flickering in his big yellow hand.",
            "\"You should not be in this house, Manan.\"",
            "\"No. No. I know. I shouldn't be in this House. Well, good night, little one\u0160 Good night.\"",
            "The child said nothing. Manan slowly turned around and went away. The glimmer died from the high cell walls. The little girl, who had no name any more but Ahra, the Eaten One, lay on her back looking steadily at the dark.",

            "Import version. Midnight Memories, the new album from One Direction is a record which documents just how far they've come in the music industry. It's an album which, the boys themselves confess, has opened up a bigger creative role for them individually allowing them all to co-write most of the 14 tracks and once again work with some well-respected songwriters. Joining them on this record are Julian Bunetta (Olly Murs, Leona Lewis, JLS), Jamie Scott (Enrique Iglesias, JLS, Little Mix) and Jacknife Lee (Blur, Robbie Williams, Biffy Clyro) as well as international artists with song-writing credits of their own such as Tom Fletcher, Danny Jones and Dougie Poynter from McFly, One Republic's Ryan Tedder and Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody. An impressive line-up. In just one listen, it's clear the new tracks are more mature, more honest and more indicative of the boys' lives. They tell the story of their journeys across the world, of being away from home, falling in love and the opportunity they ve been given.Track List: 1. Best Song Ever 2. Story of My Life 3. Diana 4. Midnight Memories 5. You & I 6. Don't Forget Where You Belong 7. Strong 8. Happily 9. Right Now 10. Little Black Dress 11. Through the Dark 12. Something Great 13. Little White Lies 14.

        "description": [
            "Born mute, speaking only in sign, Edgar Sawtelle leads an idyllic life with his parents on their farm in remote northern Wisconsin. For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose thoughtful companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. But with the unexpected return of Claude, Edgar's paternal uncle, turmoil consumes the Sawtelles' once peaceful home. When Edgar's father dies suddenly, Claude insinuates himself into the life of the farm--and into Edgar's mother's affections. Grief-stricken and bewildered, Edgar tries to prove Claude played a role in his father's death, but his plan backfires--spectacularly. Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who follow him. But his need to face his father's murderer and his devotion to the Sawtelle dogs turn Edgar ever homeward. David Wroblewski is a master storyteller, and his breathtaking scenes--the elemental north woods, the sweep of seasons, an iconic American barn, a fateful vision rendered in the falling rain--create a riveting family saga, a brilliant exploration of the limits of language, and a compulsively readable modern classic."

Indeed, CBS chief Goddard Leiberson often stated that he took something of a chance in agreeing to release it and initial reviews were not entirely complimentary. Slowly but surely, however, Time Out picked up support, mainly from the buying public, who propelled the album to the #2 spot in the US and subsequently onto becoming the best selling Jazz album of the year. It's UK performance was a rather more modest single week at #11, but 'Take Five' reached the Top 10 when lifted as a single."

            "It takes an extraordinary artist to re-imagine some of the most beloved songs of the 20th century and make them completely their own. And that's precisely what James Taylor has accomplished with his brand-new album, American Standard. Recalling the best of James' early work, he infuses new sounds and fresh meaning into these timeless works of art. While these 14 carefully chosen interpretations naturally feature James' warm, one-of-a-kind vocal ability and incomparable musicianship, what makes this collection so unique is the inventive way James and his fellow co-producers, longtime collaborator Dave O'Donnell and famed musician John Pizzarelli, approached the project. Unlike most who have tackled similar material, American Standard's beautifully simple, stripped-down arrangements are based on James' skillful acoustic guitar work rather than piano and the affect is mesmerizing. This edition features two EXCLUSIVE bonus tracks: 1. My Blue Heaven 2. Moon River 3. Teach Me Tonight 4. As Easy as Rolling off a Log 5. Almost Like Being in Love 6. Sit Down You\u2019re Rockin\u2019 the Boat 7. Nearness of You 8. You\u2019ve Got To Be Carefully Taught 9. God Bless The Child 10. Pennies From Heaven 11. My Heart Stood Still 12. Ol\u2019 Man River 13. (It\u2019s Only) a Paper Moon 14. The Surrey With The Fringe on Top BONUS TRACKS 15. I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face 16. Never Never Land"

But as a reward for his heroic service in stopping a killer who had terrorized citizens throughout the country, Leo was granted the authority to establish and run a homicide department in Moscow. Now, he strives to see justice done on behalf of murder victims in the Soviet capital, while at the same time working to build a life with his wife Raisa and their adopted daughters, Zoya and Elena.Leo's past, however, can not be left behind so easily, and the legacy of his former career--the friends and families of those he had arrested as a state security officer--continues to hound him. Now, a new string of murders in the capital threaten to bring Leo's past crashing into the present, shattering the fragile foundations of his new life in Moscow, and putting his daughter Zoya's life at risk.Faced with a threat to his family, Leo is launched on a desperate, personal mission that will take him to the harsh Siberian Gulags, to the depths of the hidden criminal underworld, and into the heart of Budapest and the Hungarian uprising.

            "Child 44",
            ") depicts the paranoia and instability of the Soviet Union after the newly installed Khrushchev regime leaks a secret speech laying out Stalin's brutal abuses. Now working as a homicide detective, Leo has long since repudiated his days as an MGB officer, but his former colleagues, fearful of reprisals from their victims, have begun taking their own lives. Leo himself becomes the target of Fraera, the wife of a priest he imprisoned. Now the leader of a violent criminal gang, Fraera kidnaps Leo's daughter, Zoya, and threatens to kill Zoya if Leo doesn't liberate her husband from his gulag prison. Shifting from Moscow to Siberia and to a Hungary convulsed by revolution, this fast-paced novel is packed with too many incidents for Smith to dwell on any in great depth. Though its drama often lacks emotional resonance, this story paints a memorable portrait of post-Stalinist Russia at its dawn.",

This second novel in his planned trilogy continues the chilling drama of life in the Soviet Union just after Khrushchev's purge of Stalin in 1956. Protagonist Leo Demidov is an ex-security officer during a time when it is dangerous to have been one of Stalin's minions. Now working as a homicide detective, Demidov is being threatened by the wife of a Russian Orthodox priest, whom he was responsible for imprisoning in the old days. Now the priest's wife has every intention of killing Demidov's daughter if he does not get her husband released from the gulag. Dennis Boutsikaris's Russian accents are superb. He brings even minor characters to life and portrays sex and age differences credibly. M.C. \u00a9 AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine",

            "*Starred Review* Smith\u2019s stunning debut, Child 44 (2008), was long-listed for the 2008 Man Booker Prize. Now he\u2019s back, and so is his long-suffering, soulful, courageous hero, Leo Demidov. It\u2019s 1956, and Leo, heartsick over his dutiful work as an MGB (State Security) agent, which requires him to send innocent people to the gulag, wants only to love and support his wife, Raisa, and their two adopted daughters, Zoya and Elena. But Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s speech to the twentieth Communist Party Congress, criticizing Stalin\u2019s brutality and mandating reform, frees many former prisoners and starts a wave of brutal reprisals against Soviet bureaucrats. Leo and his family are prime targets of a driven, devious, and dangerous female gang leader, whose goal in life is to make Leo suffer more than she did. Her machinations lead Leo through the freezing sewers of Moscow to the gulag and on to Budapest, just\u00a0as\u00a0Soviet tanks are leveling it.\u00a0As in Child 44, Smith\u2019s plotting is elaborate, and his pacing is relentless. His characters are wonderfully drawn, and the near-nonstop action is utterly gripping. Again, as in the earlier book,\u00a0however, the author\u2019s greatest success is in personalizing the stunning tragedy and brutality of life for many millions of Russians. The Secret Speech is a harrowing novel, but everyone who loved Child 44 will leap to read it. --Thomas Gaughan",

            "The Queen",
            ", a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor: the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.",
            "None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (",
            "Dirty Pretty Things",
            ") deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.",

            "The second installment in the Grail Quest series, from one of our bestselling authors. In Harlequin, Thomas of Hookton travelled to France as an archer and there discovered a shadowy destiny, which linked him to a family of heretical French lords who sought Christendom's greatest relic: the Holy Grail. Vagabond continues the story of a search that Thomas is reluctant to pursue. He doubts the grail's existence, and he has other promises to keep, promises that take him back to Brittany where a vicious civil war is about to reach its climax. But other folk, far more powerful than Thomas and his friends, fear the rumour of the grail's existence and force Thomas to pursue the relic, while his enemies, faceless and ruthless, fear Thomas's destiny and determine to destroy him. Thomas's allies are few and weak: a hedge priest, a renegade French knight, a Jewish adventurer and a crippled English soldier -- but now they must unite and find greater strengths to pierce the mysteries of Christendom."

            "This audiobook (unabridged and read by the author) is dedicated to your mastery of the art of realising all your desires. The greatest gift you have been given is the gift of your imagination. Everything that now exists was once imagined. And everything that will ever exist must first be imagined. Wishes Fulfilled is designed to take you on a voyage of discovery, wherein you can begin to tap into the amazing manifesting powers that you possess within you and create a life in which all that you imagine for yourself becomes a present fact. Dr Wayne W. Dyer explores, for the first time, the region of your highest self; and definitively shows you how you can truly change your concept of yourself, embark upon a God-realised way of living and fulfill the spiritual truth that with God all things are possible - and 'all things' means that nothing is left out. By practicing the specific technique for retraining your subconscious mind, you are encouraged to not only place into your imagination what you would like to manifest for yourself, but you are given the specifics for realigning your life so you can live out your highest calling and stay connected to your Source of being. From the lofty perspective of your highest self, you will learn how to train your imagination in a new way. Your wishes - all of them - can indeed be fulfilled. By using your imagination and practicing the art of assuming the feeling of your wishes being fulfilled, and steadfastly refusing to allow any evidence of the outer world to distract you from your intentions, you will discover that you, by virtue of your spiritual awareness, possess the ability to become the person you were destined to be. This audiobook will help you See - with a capital S - that you are divine, and that you already possess an inner, invisible higher self that can and will guide you toward a mastery of the art of manifestation. You can attain this mastery through deliberate conscious control of your imagination!"

People recognise him though, as an excellent impersonator. The inevitable happens, and ranting Hitler becomes a YouTube star, gets his own TV show, becoming someone who people listen to. All while he's still trying to convince people that yes, it really is him, and yes, he really means it. This recording is unabridged . Typically abridged audiobooks are not more than 60% of the author's work and as low as 30% with characters and plotlines removed."

            "The album from the movie based on the true story of the West Country musical phenomenon The Fisherman Friends. The band of fishermen, shopkeepers, potters, and builders, that got to together 30 years ago to raise money for local charities by performing sea shanties on the beach in Port Isaac, managed to conquer the top 10 in 2010. They also performed on Glastonbury's legendary Pyramid Stage, at the prestigious Royal Albert Hall and subsequently have toured all over the UK. The film of their meteoric rise features 17 songs recorded in their local church in St Kew. Some new, some borrowed and some slightly blue. While only making cameo appearances in the film the bands unique songs and voices weave their way through the heartfelt, poignant and at times hilarious narrative, providing the bedrock for what has already been hailed as one of the film highlights of 2019. Track List: 1. Keep Hauling 2. Nelson's Blood 3. John Kanaka 4. The Coast of High Barbary 5. South Australia 6. Little liz I Love You 7. Widow Woman 8. Le Capitaine De San Malo 9.

            "When the Metropolitan Police fail to realise a serial killer is at work, London ignites over the fact that the killer's victims are young black and mixed race boys. Institutionalised racism is claimed by the community's activists and tabloids alike. Acting Superintendent Thomas Lynley is given the case, and his Scotland Yard task force is soon handling more killings and a looming tragedy. Elizabeth George brings to the familiar subject of the serial killer a freshness and clarity of vision that provide illuminating insight into the psychological complexity of the tortured criminal mind. She does so within a richly textured, thrillingly suspenseful narrative that defies any reader to predict its outcome. Nor does she neglect our favourite characters, whose private lives provide an engrossing counterpoint to their professional duties."

            "Unplugged won 1993 Grammy Awards for Album of The Year, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. It's interesting to hear Eric Clapton in an acoustic setting, because he made his mark as one of the early proponents of high-decibel rock. Stripping down the music of an artist as technically proficient and historically based as Eric Clapton was a stroke of genius. Hence, it's no surprise that the result, Unplugged, is brilliant as well. Track List: 1. Signe 2. Before You Accuse Me 3. Hey Hey 4. Tears in Heaven 5. Lonely Stranger 6. Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out 7. Layla 8. Running on Faith 9. Walkin' Blues 10. Alberta 11. San Francisco Bay Blues 12. Malted Milk 13. Old Love 14. Rollin' & Tumblin'"

The Flashman Papers 1839-1842 Volume One Flashman, soldier, duellist, lover, imposter, coward, cad and hero, triumphs in this first instalment of The Flashman Papers. His adventures as the reluctant secret agent in Afghanistan and his entry into the exclusive company of Lord Cardigan's Hussars culminate in his foulest hour -- his part in the historic disaster of the Retreat from Kabul. This is the story of a blackguard who enjoyed villainy for its own sake. Shameless, exciting and funny, Flashman's deplorable odyssey is observed with the cynical eye of a scoundrel who was honest only in reporting what he saw. He makes all other black sheep look respectable grey."

            "Recently married to James Lacey, the witty and fractious Agatha Raisin quickly finds that marriage, and love, are not all they are cracked up to be. Rather than basking in marital bliss, the newlyweds are living in separate cottages and accusing each other of infidelity. After a particularly raucous fight in the local pub, James suddenly vanishes-a bloodstain the only clue to his fate-and Agatha is the prime suspect. Determined to clear her name and find her husband, Agatha begins her investigation. But her sleuthing is thwarted when James's suspected mistress, Melissa, is found murdered. Joined by her old friend Sir Charles, Agatha digs into Melissa's past and uncovers two ex-husbands, an angry sister, and dubious relations with bikers. Are Melissa's death and James's disappearance connected? Will Agatha reunite with her husband or will she find herself alone once again?"

            "Martin Freeman has the likable manner, precise diction, and restrained silliness that the comedic Hitchhiker books require, as well as, of course, a British accent. In this third book, reluctant space traveler Arthur Dent and associates must stop the inhabitants of the planet Krikkit from destroying the universe because they're upset at not being alone in it. Freeman provides accents--his American accents are accurate, if exaggerated--and funny voices, and his voice is also electronically altered for special effects. At times it's over-the-top goofy, and some of the voice distortions verge on lacking clarity, but generally he's as clear as the sometimes complex whimsy demands.

Here, the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan, stalked by enemies seen and unseen and plagued by a divided family, leads a sprawling force of horsemen beyond the realm of their known world. He will bring a storm to Arab lands and face the armies of the shah in all their strength. From the fierce cold plains of Mongolia to the Korean Peninsula, Genghis\u2019s brothers, sons, and commanders have made emperors bow, slaughtering vast armies of fighting men. But as Genghis enters a strange new land of towering mountains and arid desert, he stirs an enemy greater than any he has met before. Under his command, Shah Ala-ud-Din Mohammed has thousands of fierce Arab warriors, teeming cavalry, and terrifying armored elephants. When Genghis strikes, the Arabs prove their mettle. On the verge of defeat, Genghis is forced to leave his own vast encampment, and the women and children in it, in the path of an enraged, savage enemy. While the Mongols\u2014men, women, and children\u2014fight back, as secret assassins are sent into the night, another battle is taking shape. Two of Genghis\u2019s sons, Jochi and Chagatai, are steeped in enmity. Warriors choose between them, and a murderer commits an unspeakable crime. Soon the most powerful man in the world, who has brought devastation to this land, must choose a successor. And when he does, it will touch off the most bitter conflict of all.

The Arabs prove to be formidable enemies, and the Mongols spend years attempting to defeat them. Meanwhile, Genghis is threatened by forces within his own camp as two of his sons vie for influence among factions of warriors. Iggulden\u2019s mastery of the battle scene is in evidence as the brutally long campaign rages on. This appropriately page-turning treatment of a sweeping historical saga will appeal to fans of gritty combat fiction. --Margaret Flanagan",

            "THE WIND HAD FALLEN on the high ridge. Dark clouds drifted above, making bands of shadow march across the earth. The morning was quiet and the land seemed empty as the two men rode at the head of a narrow column, a jagun of a hundred young warriors. The Mongols could have been alone for a thousand miles, with just creaking leather and snorting ponies to break the stillness. When they halted to listen, it was as if silence rolled back in over the dusty ground.Tsubodai was a general to the Great Khan, and it showed in the way he held himself. His armor of iron scales over leather was well worn, with holes and rust in many places. His helmet was marked where it had saved his life more than once. All his equipment was battered, but the man himself remained as hard and unforgiving as the winter earth. In three years of raiding the north, he had lost only one minor skirmish and returned the following day to destroy the tribe before word could spread. He had mastered his trade in a land that seemed to grow colder with each mile into the wastes. He had no maps for his journey, just rumors of distant cities built on rivers frozen so solid that oxen could be roasted on the ice. At his right shoulder rode Jochi, the eldest son of the khan himself. Barely seventeen, he was yet a warrior who might inherit the nation and perhaps command even Tsubodai in war. Jochi wore a similar set of greased leather and iron, as well as the saddle packs and weapons all the warriors carried. Tsubodai knew without asking that Jochi would have his ration of dried blood and milk, needing only water to make a nourishing broth. The land did not forgive those who took survival lightly, and both men had learned the lessons of winter.Jochi sensed the scrutiny and his dark eyes flickered up, always guarded. He had spent more time with the young general than he ever had with his father, but old habits were hard to break. It was difficult for him to trust, though his respect for Tsubodai knew no limit. The general of the Young Wolves had a feel for war, though he denied it. Tsubodai believed in scouts, training, tactics, and archery above all else, but the men who followed him saw only that he won, no matter what the odds. As others could fashion a sword or a saddle, Tsubodai fashioned armies, and Jochi knew he was privileged to learn at his side. He wondered if his brother Chagatai had fared as well in the east. It was easy to daydream as he rode the hills, imagining his brothers and father struck dumb at the sight of how Jochi had grown and become strong. \"What is the most important item in your packs?\" Tsubodai said suddenly.Jochi raised his eyes to the brooding sky for an instant. Tsubodai delighted in testing him.\"Meat, General. Without meat, I cannot fight.\"\"Not your bow?\" Tsubodai said. \"Without a bow, what are you?\"\"Nothing, General, but without meat, I am too weak to use the bow.\"Tsubodai grunted at hearing his own words repeated. \"When the meat is all gone, how long can you live off blood and milk?\"\"Sixteen days at most, with three remounts to share the wounds.\"\u00a0 Jochi did not have to think. He had been drilled in the answers ever since he and Tsubodai had ridden with ten thousand men from the shadow of the Chin emperor's city.\"How far could you travel in such a time?\" Tsubodai said.Jochi shrugged.\u00a0 \"Sixteen hundred miles with fresh remounts. Half again as far if I slept and ate in the saddle.\" Tsubodai saw that the young man was hardly concentrating, and his eyes glinted as he changed tack. \"What is wrong with the ridge ahead?\" he snapped.Jochi raised his head, startled. \"I . . .\"\"Quickly! Men are looking to you for a decision. Lives wait on your word.\"Jochi swallowed, but in Tsubodai he had learned from a master.\"The sun is behind us, so we will be visible for miles as we reach the crest.\" Tsubodai began to nod, but Jochi went on. \"The ground is dusty. If we cross the high point of the ridge at any speed, we will raise a cloud into the air.\"\"That is good, Jochi,\" Tsubodai said. As he spoke, he dug in his heels and rode hard at the crest ahead. As Jochi had predicted, the hundred riders released a mist of reddish grit that billowed above their heads. Someone would surely see and report their position.Tsubodai did not pause as he reached the ridge. Digging in his heels, he sent his mare over, the rear legs skittering on loose stones. Jochi matched him and then took a sharp breath of dust that made him cough into his hand. Tsubodai had come to a halt fifty paces beyond the ridge, where the broken ground began to dip to the valley. Without orders, his men formed a wide double rank around him, like a bow drawn on the ground. They were long familiar with the firebrand of a general who had been placed over them. Tsubodai stared into the distance, frowning. The surrounding hills enclosed a flat plain through which a river ran, swollen with spring rain. Along its banks, a slow-moving column trotted, bright with flags and banners. In other circumstances, it would have been a sight to take the breath, and even as his stomach clenched, Jochi felt a touch of admiration. Ten, perhaps eleven thousand Russian knights rode together, house colors in gold and red streaming back over their heads. Almost as many followed them in a baggage train of carts and remounts, women, boys, and servants. The sun chose that moment to break through the dark clouds in a great beam that lit the valley. The knights shone.Their horses were massive, shaggy animals, almost twice the weight of the Mongol ponies. Even the men who rode them were a strange breed to Jochi's eyes. They sat like they were made of stone, solid and heavy in metal cloth from their cheeks to their knees. Only their blue eyes and hands were unprotected. The armored knights had come prepared for battle, carrying long spears like lances, but tipped in steel. They rode with the weapons upright, the butts held in leather cups close behind the stirrups. Jochi could see axes and swords hanging down from waist belts, and every man rode with a leaf-shaped shield hooked to his saddle. The pennants streamed back over their heads and they looked very fine in the bands of gold and shadow. \"They must see us,\" Jochi murmured, glancing at the plume of dust above his head.The general heard him speak and turned in the saddle. \"They are not men of the plains, Jochi. They are half blind over such a distance. Are you afraid? They are so large, these knights. I would be afraid.\"For an instant, Jochi glowered. From his father, it would have been mockery. Yet Tsubodai spoke with a light in his eyes. The general was still in his twenties, young to command so many. Tsubodai was not afraid, though. Jochi knew the general cared nothing for the massive warhorses or the men who rode them. Instead, he placed his faith in the speed and arrows of his Young Wolves.The jagun was made up of ten arbans, each commanded by an officer. By Tsubodai's order, only those ten men wore heavy armor. The rest had only leather tunics under padded deels. Jochi knew Genghis preferred the heavy charge to the light, but Tsubodai's men seemed to survive. They could hit and gallop faster than the ponderous Russian warriors, and there was no fear in their ranks. Like Tsubodai, they looked hungrily down the slope at the column and waited to be seen.\"You know your father sent a rider to bring me home?\" Tsubodai said.Jochi nodded. \"All the men know.\"\"I had hoped to go further north than this, but I am your father's man. He speaks and I obey, do you understand?\"Jochi stared at the young general, forgetting for a moment the knights who rode in the valley below.\"Of course,\" he said, his face showing nothing.Tsubodai glanced back at him, amused. \"I hope you do, Jochi. He is a man to follow, your father. I wonder how he will respond when he sees how well you have grown.\"For a moment, anger twisted Jochi's face before he smoothed his features and took a deep breath. Tsubodai had been more like a father than his own in many ways, but he did not forget the man's true loyalty. At an order from Genghis, Tsubodai would kill him. As he looked at the young general, he thought there would be some regret, but not enough to hold the blow.\"He will need loyal men, Tsubodai,\" Jochi said. \"My father would not call us back to build or rest. He will have found some new land to tear to pieces. Like the wolf, he is always hungry, even to the point of bursting his own stomach.\"Tsubodai frowned to hear the khan described in such a way. In three years, he had seen no affection when Jochi spoke of his father, though sometimes there was a wistfulness that showed less and less as the seasons passed. Genghis had sent away a boy, but a man would return to him, Tsubodai had made certain of that. For all his bitterness, Jochi was a cool head in battle and the men looked on him with pride. He would do.\"I have another question for you, Jochi,\" Tsubodai said.Jochi smiled for an instant. \"You always have, General,\" he replied. \"We have drawn these iron knights after us for hundreds of miles, exhausting their horses. We have captured their scouts and put them to the question, though I do not know of this 'Jerusalem' they seek, or who this 'white Christ' is.\" Tsubodai shrugged. \"Perhaps I will meet him one day over the length of my sword, but the world is large and I am but one man.\" As he spoke, he watched the armored knights and the trailing baggage lines behind them, waiting to be seen.\"My question, Jochi, is this. These knights are nothing to me. Your father has called me back and I could ride now, while the ponies are fat with summer grass. Why then are we here, waiting for the challenge?\"Jochi's eyes were cold as he replied.\"My father would say it is what we do, that there is no better way for a man to spend his years than at war with enemies. He might also say you enjoy it, General, and that is all the reason you need.\"Tsubodai's gaze did not waver. \"Perhaps he would say that, but you hide behind his words. Why are we here, Jochi? We do not want their big horses, even for meat. Why will I risk the lives of warriors to smash the column you see?\"Jochi shrugged irritably. \"If it is not that, I do not know.\"\"For you, Jochi,\" Tsubodai said seriously. \"When you return to your father, you will have seen all forms of battle, in all seasons. You and I have captured towns and raided cities, ridden desert and forests so thick we could hardly cut our way through. Genghis will find no weakness in you.\" Tsubodai smiled briefly at Jochi's stony expression. \"I will be proud when men say you learned your skill under Tsubodai the Valiant.\"Jochi had to grin at hearing the nickname from Tsubodai himself. There were no secrets in the camps.\"There it is,\" Tsubodai muttered, pointing to a distant messenger racing to the head of the Russian column. \"We have an enemy who leads from the front, a very brave man.\"Jochi could imagine the sudden dismay among the knights as they looked into the bowl of hills and saw the Mongol warriors. Tsubodai grunted softly as an entire rank peeled off the column and began trotting up the slopes, the long spears ready. He showed his teeth as the gap began to narrow. They were charging uphill, in their arrogance. He longed to teach them their error.\"Do you have your paitze, Jochi? Show it to me.\"Jochi reached behind him to where his bow holder was strapped to the saddle. He lifted a flap in the stiff leather and pulled out a plaque of solid gold, stamped with a wolf's head in profile. At twenty ounces, it was heavy, but small enough for him to grip in his hand.Tsubodai ignored the men rising doggedly up the hill to face the eldest son of Genghis.\"You have that and the right to command a thousand by my hand, Jochi. Those who command a jagun have one of mere silver, like this.\" Tsubodai held up a larger block of the whitish metal. \"The difference is that the silver paitze is given to a man elected by the officers of each arban below him.\"\"I know this,\" Jochi said.Tsubodai glanced back at the knights laboring closer. \"The officers of this jagun have asked to have you lead them, Jochi. I had no part in it.\" He held out the silver paitze and Jochi took it joyfully, passing back the plaque of gold.Tsubodai was solemn and deliberately formal, but his eyes were bright. \"When you return to your father, Jochi, you will have known all ranks and positions.\" The general gestured, cutting the air with his hand. \"On the right, the left, and the center.\" He looked over the heads of the straining knights cantering up the hill, seeing a flicker of movement on a crag in the distance. Tsubodai nodded sharply.\"It is time. You know what you have to do, Jochi. Command is yours.\" Without another word, Tsubodai clapped the younger man on the shoulder and rode back over the ridge, leaving the jagun of riders in the care of one suddenly nervous leader.Jochi could feel the combined stares of the hundred men on his back as he struggled to hide his pleasure. Each arban of ten elected one man to lead them, then those men elected one of their number to lead the hundred in war. To be so chosen was an honor. A voice in his mind whispered that they only honored his father, but he crushed it, refusing to doubt. He had earned the right and confidence swelled in him.\"Bow lines!\" Jochi called. He gripped his reins tightly to hide his tension as the men formed a wider line so that every bow could bear. Jochi glanced over his shoulder, but Tsubodai had truly gone, leaving him alone. The men still watched and he forced the cold face, knowing they would remember his calm. As they raised their bows, he held up a clenched fist, waiting while his heart thumped painfully in his chest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At four hundred paces, Jochi dropped his arm and the first flight of arrows whipped into the air. It was too far and those that reached the knights splintered on their shields, now held high and forward, so that almost the entire man was protected. The long shields showed their purpose as a second flight struck the ranks without a single rider going down.The powerful horses were not fast, but still the gap closed and Jochi only watched. At two hundred paces, he raised his fist once more and another hundred arrows waited on creaking strings. At such a distance, he did not know if the knights' armor would save them. Nothing ever had. \"Shoot like you have never owned a bow,\" he shouted. The men around him grinned and the arrows snapped out. Jochi winced instinctively at shafts that went clear over the enemy heads, as if loosed by panicking fools. Only a few struck, and of those, still fewer brought a horse or man down. They could hear the thunder of the charge now and saw the front ranks begin to lower their spears in anticipation.Facing them, Jochi smothered his fear in a sudden bloom of rage. He wanted nothing more than to draw his sword and kick his mount down the slope at the enemy. Shaking with frustration, he gave a different order.\"Retreat over the ridge,\" Jochi shouted. He wrenched at his reins and his horse jerked into a run. His jagun shouted incoherently, turning in chaos after their general. Behind him, he heard guttural voices yelling in triumph and acid rose in his throat, though whether it was from fear or anger, he did not know.",

            "Starred Review. The exciting third novel in Iggulden's Genghis Khan series tells the dramatic story of the Mongol invasion and conquest of Central Asia. Genghis has already defeated the Chinese and Koreans, and now marches his vast army west to punish and conquer the Muslim lands of central Asia ruled by Shah Mohammed. For eight years the Mongols ravage the shah's empire, crushing armies, destroying cities and slaughtering anyone who resists. Iggulden's vivid descriptions of bloody battles, masterful sieges and political intrigue are gripping, showcasing Genghis's brilliance as a strategist, tactician, administrator and leader. Side plots include the deadly rivalry between two of Genghis's sons, the rape and murder of Genghis's sister by a trusted adviser, the surprising rise of the shah's son as a capable enemy and the treachery of Genghis's son toward his father. This is epic historical fiction at its finest: exciting, suspenseful, colorful and well-grounded in fact. With this tale, it is easy to see why the name Genghis is synonymous with conquest and military genius.",

            "Muse didn't set out to make the most gloriously ambitious album of their career. How could they have? The band who dreamt up \"Supermassive Black Hole,\" Knights Of Cydonia and the three-part \"Exogenesis\" symphony were already well-versed in going One Louder. Any wilder, any further out there, and Muse would risk incineration by a dwarf star of their own making. But you don't become one of the biggest bands on this planet by sitting on your hands. So when Muse approached the making of their sixth studio album, they wouldn't stint on the choirs, strings and horn sections. And be reassured: guitar-shredding, piano-thumping, orchestra-arranging, book-chewing, big-thinking Matt Bellamy, as the band's chief songwriter, didn't lower his sights from The Big Picture nor ignore The Precious Details. And nor were the trio afraid of giving space to a brilliant new element to their sound - songs written and sung by bass player Chris Wolstenholme.  Track List: 1. Supremacy 2. Madness 3. Panic Station 4. Prelude 5. Survival 6. Follow Me 7. Animals 8. Explorers 9. Big Freeze 10. Save Me 11. Liquid State 12. The 2nd Law: Unsustainable 13. The 2nd Law: Isolated System"

At the same moment on the other side of the globe, in the middle of a crowd of Chinese New Year revellers, Jake realises that things are becoming dangerous. They know nothing of one another's existence, but both Stella and Jake flee their lives: Jake in search of a place so remote it doesn't appear on any map, and Stella for a destination in Scotland, the significance of which only her sister, Nina, will understand. Gripping, insightful and deft, this is Maggie O'Farrell's finest achievement to date."

Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of the First World War, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in over 100 foreign languages. She is the author of 80 crime novels and short story collections, 19 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.",

            "INCLUDES A BONUS MP3 CD OF JEFFERY DEAVER'S THE BLUE NOWHERE! The latest Kathryn Dance thriller from the New York Times bestselling author of The Sleeping Doll! The Monterey Peninsula is rocked when a killer begins to leave roadside crosses beside local highways -- not in memoriam, but as announcements of his intention to kill. And to kill in particularly horrific and efficient ways: using the personal details about the victims that they've carelessly posted in blogs and on social networking websites. The case lands on the desk of Kathryn Dance, the California Bureau of Investigations foremost body language expert. She and Deputy Michael O'Neil follow the leads to Travis Brigham, a troubled teenager whose role in a fatal car accident has inspired vicious attacks against him on a popular blog, The Chilton Report. As the investigation progresses, Travis vanishes. Using techniques he learned as a brilliant participant in multiplayer online role-playing games, he easily eludes his pursuers and continues to track his victims. Among the obstacles Kathryn must hurdle are politicians from Sacramento, paranoid parents and the blogger himself, James Chilton, whose belief in the importance of blogging and the new media threatens to derail the case and potentially Dance's career. It is this threat that causes Dance to take desperate and risky measures... In signature Jeffery Deaver style, Roadside Crosses is filled with dozens of plot twists, cliff-hangers and heartrending personal subplots. It is also a searing look at the accountability of blogging and life in the online world. Roadside Crosses is the third in Deaver's bestselling High-Tech Thriller Trilogy, along with The Blue Nowhere and The Broken Window."

            "Cat Stevens tends to be lumped in with the early-1970s singer/songwriter school led by James Taylor and Carole King but he actually fits in rather neatly with such wistful contemporaries as Nick Drake, Syd Barrett and Donovan. Tea for the Tillerman's \"Wild World\", \"Into White\" and \"Longer Boats\" indicate that he may have been a more gifted tunesmith than the lot of them. As with the best of the Brit folk-rockers, Stevens mixed melancholy with whimsy. Yes, he was prone to airy platitudes but when he harnessed his eccentricities, as he did throughout this 1970's masterwork, you had something truly distinctive.  Tracklist:  1. Where Do the Children Play?  2. Hard Headed Woman  3. Wild World  4. Sad Lisa  5. Miles from Nowhere  6. But I Might Die Tonight  7. Longer Boats  8. Into White  9. On the Road to Find Out  10. Father and Son  11. Tea for The Tillerman"

            "One of the most enduring musical partnerships of our time, Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Crosby, Stills & Nash are revered for their peerless vocal harmonies, inspired songwriting and musical virtuosity. When the trio first sang together at a friend's Laurel Canyon house in 1968, their uncanny harmonic convergence was immediately apparent, and CSN took shape. Each member came to the new venture from other high-profile bands-Crosby from the Byrds, Stills from Buffalo Springfield, and Nash from the Hollies-and together, they formed that rarest of musical entities, a \"supergroup\" that lived up to its billing. CSN's 1969 self-titled debut album is one of the true masterpieces of the rock 'n' roll canon, and 1982's Daylight Again is a brilliant portrait of their musical evolution. Still touring and recording together, CSN is an American treasure.  Tracklist:  1. Suite: Judy Blue Eyes  2. Marrakesh Express  3. Guinnevere  4. You Don't Have to Cry  5. Pre-Road Downs  6. Wooden Ships  7. Lady of The Island  8. Helplessly Hoping  9. Long Time Gone   Bonus tracks:  10. 49 Bye-Byes  11. Do for The Others  12. Song with No Words  13. Everybody's Talkin'  14. Teach Your Children"

            "2013 album from the Nashville-based singer/songwriter. On Same Trailer Different Park, it's clear that this is a girl who has something to say. A true language artist, Kacey nimbly spins webs of words to create the quirky puns, shrewd metaphors, and steely ironies that fill the record. The lead single 'Merry Go Round', garnered quick airplay and critical acclaim from the likes of Rolling Stone, NPR, and Slate, where the headline above a rave review of Kacey s work read Is This the Future of Country Music? Billboard took a different track, looking to the past to qualify its praise: Had Loretta Lynn or Dolly Parton arrived on the scene in 2012 instead of the 1960s, some of their compositions could very well have ended up sounding like this. Track List: 1. Silver Lining 2. My House 3. Merry Go \u2018Round 4. Dandelion 5. Blowin\u2019 Smoke 6. I Miss You 7. Step Off 8. Back on The Map 9. Keep It to Yourself 10. Stupid 11.

The jangle of your pocket money...the rustle of the pink and green striped paper bag... Rosie Hopkins thinks leaving her busy London life, and her boyfriend Gerard, to sort out her elderly Aunt Lilian's sweetshop in a small country village is going to be dull. Boy, is she wrong. Lilian Hopkins has spent her life running Lipton's sweetshop, through wartime and family feuds. As she struggles with the idea that it might finally be time to settle up, she also wrestles with the secret history hidden behind the jars of beautifully coloured sweets. Read by Jane Collingwood. A sweet and nostalgic listen for fans of the novel. Running time approximately: 13 hours 1 MP3 CD unabridged"

            "For Kim Woodburn finding fame in her 60s in the smash hit television series How Clean is Your House? \"with fellow dust-buster Aggie Mackenzie is like living a fairytale. Often she has simply wished that she had never been born, for Kim has overcome horrific emotional and physical abuse both at the hands of her alcoholic mother and her philandering, sexually abusive father. In her brave and revealing story Kim's memories of growing up are not of love and cuddles, but of beatings and random cruelty. Shuttled between the brutal houses of her warring parents, a succession of miserable children's homes and a grim convent -- Kim's past has cast a long shadow over her life. But just before her sixteenth birthday she finally made her escape, only to find herself in an abusive marriage a few years later. It has taken decades of hard work, and a wonderfully happy marriage to conquer depression but now she has emerged unbowed and unbeaten as Britain's Queen of Clean.",

Niko Bolas was parked adjacent to the barn, in an exquisite analog mobile recording truck, Le Mobile ready to capture and mix the album on the spot. BARN (Cassette) / NEIL & CRAZY HORSE"

            "Walls finds Barbra exploring both her concerns and hopes for the future in a collection filled with beautiful melodies and thought-provoking lyrics. In addition to the three original tunes which the Oscar-winning songwriter contributed to, the songs on Walls explore topics near to the celebrated artist's heart. Streisand also brings a fresh perspective to the classic songs \"Imagine\" and \"What A Wonderful World,\" and the Bacharach/David pop standard \"What the World Needs Now.\" The penultimate song that Streisand sings is a timely one called \"Take Care of This House\" by the legendary composer Leonard Bernstein and lyricist Alan Jay Lerner. Tracklisting: 1. What's on My Mind 2. Don't Lie to Me 3. Imagine / What a Wonderful World 4. Walls 5. Lady Liberty 6. What the World Needs Now 7. Better Angels 8. Love's Never Wrong 9. The Rain Will Fall 10. Take Care of This House 11. Happy Days Are Here Again"

It seems that Landen, her husband of four weeks, actually drowned in an accident when he was two years old. Someone, somewhere, sometime, is responsible. The sinister Goliath Corporation wants its operative Jack Schitt out of the poem in which Thursday trapped him, and it will do almost anything to achieve this - but bribing the ChronoGuard? Is that possible? Having barely caught her breath after The Eyre Affair, Thursday must battle corrupt politicians, try to save the world from extinction, and help the Neanderthals to species self-determination. Mastadon migrations, journeys into Just William, a chance meeting with the Flopsy Bunnies, and violent life-and-death struggles in the summer sales are all part of a greater plan. But whose? and why?"

            "illuminates history to enlighten our present, when the need for a free and independent press is more important than ever. In 90 breathtaking minutes of efficient and intricate storytelling, writer-director George Clooney and cowriter Grant Heslov pay honorable tribute to the journalistic integrity of legendary CBS newscaster Edward R. Murrow,  Director George Clooney who confronted the virulent and overzealous anti-Communist witch-hunting of Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1953-54, and emerged as a triumphant truth-seeker against the abuses of corporate and governmental power.  David Strathairn as Edward R. Murrow As played by David Strathairn, Murrow is a dogged realist, keenly aware of the smear tactics that will be employed against him; Clooney provides crucial backup as Murrow's \"See It Now\" producer and closest confidante Fred Friendly, forming a fierce but not entirely fearless triumvirate of broadcasting bravery with CBS chief William Paley (Frank Langella), who anxiously champions Murrow's cause under constant threat of reprisals. While using crisp black-and-white cinematography (by Robert Elswit) to vividly recreate the electrifying atmosphere of the CBS newsroom and the early years of television, Clooney (son of long-time Cincinnati newsman Nick Clooney) proves his directorial skill by juggling big themes and an esteemed ensemble cast, never stooping to simplification of ethically complex material.",

            "From Publishers Weekly",
            "An average of 1 in 110 children has autism spectrum disorder, an astonishing number that also bespeaks sadness and frustration on the part of lots of parents of autistic children. Popular and prolific novelist Kingsbury (Ever After) takes on autism in the story Holden Harris, an 18-year-old high school student with autism and target for high school bullies. Popular Ella Reynolds, star of the high school's musical Beauty and the Beast, sticks up for Holden against her friends who are his tormentors. Added to the complex topics of autism and bullying is a subplot about teen-age suicide, making for far more weight than this story can bear. Her legions of fans may well find this nicey-nicey story resolution inspirational; that is the Kingsbury brand. But given the gravity of the subjects, what one finds inspirational another will likely see a na\u00efve and unpersuasive fantasy that Walt Disney does a whole lot better, with music. Kingsbury is in over her head. (Oct.) (c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC. All rights reserved.",

            "MCA Nashville recording artist Sam Hunt is soaring up the country charts with his lead single, Leave the Night On the lead track off his Oct. 27 major label album debut, MONTEVALLO, a ten-track album, all co-written by Hunt, and produced by Zach Crowell (Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban) and Shane McAnally (Luke Bryan, Kacey Musgraves). This is such a personal album for me, explains Hunt. Each song holds truth and comes from my own life experiences. To get these songs out into the hands of the fans is both exciting and liberating. While completing MONTEVALLO, Hunt has continued to gain momentum on the road and grow his fanbase. As a result of their enthusiasm, last month Hunt offered fans X2C, a four-song album preview including hit song Leave the Night On. The album teaser fueled the excitement surrounding Hunt and his upcoming project. For a VERY limited time only and offered exclusively by Amazon, get this limited-edition autographed version!"
