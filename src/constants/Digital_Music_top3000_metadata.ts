Now, Robie becomes a target himself and is on the run.Fleeing the scene, Robie crosses paths with a wayward teenage girl, a fourteen-year-old runaway from a foster home.

He needs to help her. Even worse, the more Robie learns about the girl, the more he's convinced she is at the center of a vast cover-up, one that may explain her parents' deaths and stretch to unimaginable levels of power.Now, Robie may have to step out of the shadows in order to save this girl's life...and perhaps his own.",

      "The circus arrives without warning.No announcements precede it, no paper notices on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or advertisements in local newspapers. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.The towering tents are striped in white and black, no golds and crimsons to be seen. No color at all, save for the neighboring trees and the grass of the surrounding fields. Black-and-white stripes on grey sky; countless tents of varying shapes and sizes, with an elaborate wrought-iron fence encasing them in a colorless world. Even what little ground is visible from outside is black or white, painted or powdered, or treated with some other circus trick.But it is not open for business. Not just yet.Within hours everyone in town has heard about it. By afternoon the news has spread several towns over. Word of mouth is a more effective method of advertisement than typeset words and exclamation points on paper pamphlets or posters. It is impressive and unusual news, the sudden appearance of a mysterious circus. People marvel at the staggering height of the tallest tents. They stare at the clock that sits just inside the gates that no one can properly describe.And the black sign painted in white letters that hangs upon the gates, the one that reads:",

      "Closes at Dawn",
      "\u201cWhat kind of circus is only open at night?\u201d people ask. No one has a proper answer, yet as dusk approaches there is a substantial crowd of spectators gathering outside the gates.You are amongst them, of course. Your curiosity got the better of you, as curiosity is wont to do. You stand in the fading light, the scarf around your neck pulled up against the chilly evening breeze, waiting to see for yourself exactly what kind of circus only opens once the sun sets.The ticket booth clearly visible behind the gates is closed and barred. The tents are still, save for when they ripple ever so slightly in the wind. The only movement within the circus is the clock that ticks by the passing minutes, if such a wonder of sculpture can even be called a clock.The circus looks abandoned and empty. But you think perhaps you can smell caramel wafting through the evening breeze, beneath the crisp scent of the autumn leaves. A subtle sweetness at the edges of the cold.The sun disappears completely beyond the horizon, and the remaining luminosity shifts from dusk to twilight. The people around you are growing restless from waiting, a sea of shuffling feet, murmuring about abandoning the endeavor in search of someplace warmer to pass the evening. You yourself are debating departing when it happens.First, there is a popping sound. It is barely audible over the wind and conversation. A soft noise like a kettle about to boil for tea. Then comes the light.All over the tents, small lights begin to flicker, as though the entirety of the circus is covered in particularly bright fireflies. The waiting crowd quiets as it watches this display of illumination. Someone near you gasps. A small child claps his hands with glee at the sight.When the tents are all aglow, sparkling against the night sky, the sign appears. Stretched across the top of the gates, hidden in curls of iron, more firefly-like lights flicker to life. They pop as they brighten, some accompanied by a shower of glowing white sparks and a bit of smoke. The people nearest to the gates take a few steps back.At first, it is only a random pattern of lights. But as more of them ignite, it becomes clear that they are aligned in scripted letters.

      "UNEXPECTED POST",
      "New York, February 1873The man billed as Prospero the Enchanter receives a fair amount of correspondence via the theater office, but this is the first envelope addressed to him that contains a suicide note, and it is also the first to arrive carefully pinned to the coat of a five-year-old girl.The lawyer who escorts her to the theater refuses to explain despite the manager\u2019s protestations, abandoning her as quickly as he can with no more than a shrug and the tip of a hat.The theater manager does not need to read the envelope to know who the girl is for. The bright eyes peering out from under a cloud of unruly brown curls are smaller, wider versions of the magician\u2019s own.He takes her by the hand, her small fingers hanging limp within his. She refuses to remove her coat despite the warmth of the theater, giving only an adamant shake of her head when he asks her why.The manager takes the girl to his office, not knowing what else to do with her. She sits quietly on an uncomfortable chair beneath a line of framed posters advertising past productions, surrounded by boxes of tickets and receipts. The manager brings her a cup of tea with an extra lump of sugar, but it remains on the desk, untouched, and grows cold.The girl does not move, does not fidget in her seat. She stays perfectly still with her hands folded in her lap. Her gaze is fixed downward, focused on her boots that do not quite touch the floor. There is a small scuff on one toe, but the laces are knotted in perfect bows.The sealed envelope hangs from the second topmost button of her coat, until Prospero arrives.She hears him before the door opens, his footsteps heavy and echoing in the hall, unlike the measured pace of the manager who has come and gone several times, quiet as a cat.\u201cThere is also a\u2008.\u2008.\u2008.\u2008package for you, sir,\u201d the manager says as he opens the door, ushering the magician into the cramped office before slipping off to attend to other theater matters, having no desire to witness what might become of this encounter.The magician scans the office, a stack of letters in one hand, a black velvet cape lined with shockingly white silk cascading behind him, expecting a paper-wrapped box or crate. Only when the girl looks up at him with his own eyes does he realize what the theater manager was referring to.Prospero the Enchanter\u2019s immediate reaction upon meeting his daughter is a simple declaration of: \u201cWell, fuck.\u201dThe girl returns her attention to her boots.The magician closes the door behind him, dropping the stack of letters on the desk next to the teacup as he looks at the girl.He rips the envelope from her coat, leaving the pin clinging steadfastly to its button.While the writing on the front bears his stage name and the theater address, the letter inside greets him with his given name, Hector Bowen.He skims over the contents, any emotional impact desired by the author failing miserably and finally. He pauses at the only fact he deems relevant: that this girl now left in his custody is, obviously, his own daughter and that her name is Celia.\u201cShe should have named you Miranda,\u201d the man called Prospero the Enchanter says to the girl with a chuckle. \u201cI suppose she was not clever enough to think of it.\u201dThe girl looks up at him again. Dark eyes narrow beneath her curls.The teacup on the desk begins to shake. Ripples disrupt the calm surface as cracks tremble across the glaze, and then it collapses in shards of flowered porcelain. Cold tea pools in the saucer and drips onto the floor, leaving sticky trails along the polished wood.The magician\u2019s smile vanishes. He glances back at the desk with a frown, and the spilled tea begins seeping back up from the floor. The cracked and broken pieces stand and re-form themselves around the liquid until the cup sits complete once more, soft swirls of steam rising into the air.The girl stares at the teacup, her eyes wide.Hector Bowen takes his daughter\u2019s face in his gloved hand, scrutinizing her expression for a moment before releasing her, his fingers leaving long red marks across her cheeks.\u201cYou might be interesting,\u201d he says.The girl does not reply.He makes several attempts to rename her in the following weeks, but she refuses to respond to anything but Celia.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Several months later, once he decides she is ready, the magician writes a letter of his own.

    description: [
      "At the edge of the continent, Crosby, Maine, may seem like nowhere, but seen through this brilliant writer\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s in essence the whole world, and the lives that are lived there are filled with all of the grand human drama - desire, despair, jealousy, hope, and love. At times stern, at other times patient, at times perceptive, at other times in sad denial, Olive Kitteridge, a retired schoolteacher, deplores the changes in her little town and in the world at large, but she doesn\u2019t always recognize the changes in those around her: a lounge musician haunted by a past romance; a former student who has lost the will to live; Olive\u2019s own adult child, who feels tyrannized by her irrational sensitivities; and her husband, Henry, who finds his loyalty to his marriage both a blessing and a curse. As the townspeople grapple with their problems, mild and dire, Olive is brought to a deeper understanding of herself and her life \u2013 sometimes painfully, but always with ruthless honesty. Olive Kitteridge offers profound insights into the human condition - its conflicts, its tragedies and joys, and the endurance it requires. 2009 Pulitzer Prize winner in the Letters, Drama and Music category",

Berlin 1942 When Bruno returns home from school one day, he discovers that his belongings are being packed in crates. His father has received a promotion and the family must move from their home to a new house far far away, where there is no one to play with and nothing to do. A tall fence running alongside stretches as far as the eye can see and cuts him off from the strange people he can see in the distance. But Bruno longs to be an explorer and decides that there must be more to this desolate new place than meets the eye. While exploring his new environment, he meets another boy whose life and circumstances are very different to his own, and their meeting results in a friendship that has devastating consequences.",

      "THIS IS THE CD VERSION AND NOT THE VINYL VERSION. 2009 Digital Remaster / Enhanced / Digipack The classic original Beatles studio albums have been re-mastered by a dedicated team of engineers at Abbey Road Studios in London over a four-year period utilizing state of the art recording technology alongside vintage studio equipment, carefully maintaining the authenticity and integrity of the original analogue recordings. The result of this painstaking process is the highest fidelity the Beatles catalogue has seen since its original release. Within each CD's new packaging, booklets include detailed historical notes along with informative recording notes. For a limited period, each CD will also be embedded with a brief documentary film about the album. The newly produced mini-documentaries on the making of each album, directed by Bob Smeaton, are included as QuickTime files on each album. The documentaries contain archival footage, rare photographs and never-before-heard studio chat from The Beatles, offering a unique and very personal insight into the studio atmosphere. Tracklisting: 1. Come Together 2. Something 3. Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer 4. Oh! Darling 5. Octopus\u2019s Garden 6. I Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy) 7. Here Comes The Sun 8. Because 9.

    description: [
      "The Poisonwood Bible is a story told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them all they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it - from garden seeds to Scripture - is calamitously transformed on African soil. This tale of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction, over the course of three decades in postcolonial Africa, is set against history's most dramatic political parables. The Poisonwood Bible dances between the darkly comic human failings and inspiring poetic justices of our times. In a compelling exploration of religion, conscience, imperialist arrogance, and the many paths to redemption, Barbara Kingsolver has brought forth her most ambitious work ever.",

He\u2019d been sleeping rough. Probably homeless. No identification. A slip of paper with Millhone\u2019s name and number was in his pants pocket. The coroner asked her to come to the morgue to see if she could ID him. Two seemingly unrelated deaths, one a murder, the other apparently of natural causes.But as Kinsey digs deeper into the mystery of the John Doe, some very strange linkages begin to emerge.

      "Wasted lives, wasted time, and wasted opportunities are at the heart of this twenty-third entry in the long-running Kinsey Millhone series, which reveals how the deaths of two very different men impact Kinsey\u2019s life. The first man, Pete Wolinsky, found murdered in a local park, is a shady PI for whom Kinsey has little respect; the second, R. T. Dace, is an alcoholic vagrant who not only turns out to be Kinsey\u2019s relative but also leaves her a half-million bucks. Armed with news of R. T.\u2019s death, Kinsey sets out to learn more about him and why he disinherited his immediate family. The clever twists of V Is for Vengeance are mostly absent here, and readers will need to wade through a lot of story before Wolinsky\u2019s connection to Dace comes clear. But Grafton hasn\u2019t lost her touch for characterization. Nobody in the cast is a stereotype, and it\u2019s the clash of personalities and interpersonal dynamics that provide the appeal here. Nearing the conclusion of this celebrated series, Grafton continues to shape Millhone\u2019s character, toughened by circumstance but still both understanding and forgiving. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: As the end of the alphabet draws closer, expect a revival of interest in a series that has helped define the role of the female sleuth in mystery fiction. --Stephanie Zvirin",

      "Two dead men changed the course of my life that fall. One of them I knew and the other I\u2019d never laid eyes on until I saw him in the morgue. The first was Pete Wolinsky, an unscrupulous private detective I\u2019d met years before through Byrd-Shine Investigations, where I\u2019d served my apprenticeship. I worked for Ben Byrd and Morley Shine for three years, amassing the six thousand hours I needed for my license. The two were old-school private eyes, hard-working, tireless, and inventive. While Ben and Morley did business with Pete on occasion, they didn\u2019t think much of him. He was morally shabby, disorganized, and irresponsible with money. In addition, he was constantly pestering them for work, since his marketing skills were minimal and his reputation too dubious to recommend him without an outside push. Byrd-Shine might subcontract the odd stretch of surveillance to him or assign him a routine records search, but his name never appeared on a client report. This didn\u2019t prevent him from stopping by the office without invitation or dropping their names in casual conversations with attorneys, implying a close professional relationship. Pete was a man who cut corners and he assumed his colleagues did likewise. More problematic was the fact that he\u2019d rationalized his bad behavior for so long it had become standard operating procedure.",
      "Pete Wolinsky was gunned down the night of August 25 on a dark stretch of pavement just off the parking lot at the Santa Teresa Bird Refuge. The site was right across the street from the Caliente Caf\u00e9, a popular hangout for off-duty cops. It might seem odd that no one in the bar was aware that shots were fired, but the volume on the jukebox exceeds 117 dB, roughly the equivalent of a gas-powered chainsaw at a distance of three feet. The rare moments of quiet are masked by the high-pitched rattle of ice cubes in dueling blenders where margaritas are whipped up at a rate of one every four and a half minutes.",
      "Pete\u2019s body might not have been discovered until daylight if it hadn\u2019t been for an inebriated bar patron who stepped into the shadows to take a leak. I heard about Pete\u2019s death on the morning news while I was eating my Cheerios. The TV set was on in the living room behind me, more for the company than the content. I caught his name and turned to catch a night shot of the crime scene blocked off by yellow tape. By the time the news crew had arrived, his body had been loaded into the ambulance in preparation for transport to the coroner\u2019s office, so there was really nothing to see. In the harsh glare of artificial light, a somber female reporter recited the bare facts. Pete\u2019s immediate family must have been notified by then or she wouldn\u2019t have mentioned him by name. Pete\u2019s death was a surprise, but I can\u2019t say it was a shock. He\u2019d often complained of sleeping poorly and had taken to wandering the streets at all hours. According to the reporter, his wallet had been stolen along with his watch, a knock-off Rolex with a faux-platinum band. I guess robbers these days can\u2019t distinguish the genuine article from the fake, which meant that Pete\u2019s death wound up being more about impulse or cheap thrills than profit. He was a man with a propensity for risk, and it was only a matter of time before Lady Luck caught up with him and pushed him off the cliff.",
      "The story about the second dead man is more complex and takes longer to articulate, especially since the facts emerged slowly over a matter of weeks. The coroner\u2019s office called me on a Friday afternoon, asking if I could ID a John Doe who had my name and phone number on a slip of paper in his pocket. How could I resist? Every good mystery takes place on three planes\u2014what",
      "really",
      "happened; what",
      "appears",
      "to have happened; and how the sleuth, amateur or professional (yours truly in this case), figures out which is which. I suppose I could put everything in perspective if I explained how it all turned out and then doubled back to that phone call, but it\u2019s better if you experience it just as I did, one strange step at a time.",
      "This was October 7, 1988, and it looked like things were as bad as they were going to get. On the national front, congressional spending was a whopping $1,064.14 billion and the federal debt was topping out at $2,601.3 billion. Unemployment hovered at 5.5 percent and the price of a first-class postage stamp had jumped from twenty-two cents to twenty-five. I tend to disregard issues over which I have no control. Like it or not, the politicians don\u2019t consult me about economic policies, budget cuts, or the gross national product, whatever",
      "that",
      "is. I might voice an opinion (if I had one), but as nearly as I can tell, nobody pays the slightest attention, so what\u2019s the point? My only hope is to be the master of my own small universe, which is centered in a Southern California town ninety-six miles north of Los Angeles.",
      "My name is Kinsey Millhone. I\u2019m a private investigator, female, age thirty-eight. I rent office space in a two-room bungalow with a kitchenette and a bathroom on a narrow side street in the heart of Santa Teresa, population 85,810, minus the two dead guys. Since I\u2019m the sole proprietor and lone employee, I operate on a modest scale, supporting myself by doing missing-persons searches, background checks, witness location, and the occasional service of process. From time to time I\u2019m hired to establish paper trails in legal, financial, or property disputes. On a more personal note, let me say that I believe in law and order, loyalty, and patriotism\u2014old-fashioned values that might seem woefully out of date. I also believe in earning an honest living so I can pay my taxes, cover my monthly bills, and tuck any surplus into my retirement account.",
      "When I reached the coroner\u2019s office, I was ushered into a bay with the curtain discreetly pulled around the ceiling track. Though curious, I wasn\u2019t apprehensive. I\u2019d done a quick survey and could account for the people I knew and loved. There were those who orbited my world in a wider gyre, but I couldn\u2019t think of one whose death would have had a significant impact.",
      "The dead man was stretched out on a gurney with a sheet pulled up to his chin, so there was nothing of an intimate nature in evidence. He was not someone I recognized. His skin tones were gray, underlined with a pale gold that suggested liver issues of a profound and possibly fatal nature. His features had been softened and flattened in death, angles worn as smooth as stone over which water has poured for thousands of years. The human spirit does more than animate the face; it lends character and definition. Here, there was none.",
      "The decedent (to use the official term) appeared to be in his early seventies, white, and overweight in the manner of those who forgo their nine servings of fresh fruits and vegetables per day. Judging by the bulbous nose and broken veins across his weather-darkened face, he\u2019d enjoyed alcohol in sufficient quantities to pickle the average adult. Sometimes the dead seem to sleep. This man did not. I studied him at length, and there was not even the faintest suggestion that he was breathing. Whatever spell had been cast over him, the effects were permanent.",
      "His body had been discovered that morning in a sleeping bag on the beach where he\u2019d hollowed out a place for himself in the sand. His campsite was just below a bank of ice plant that flourished between the bike path and the beach itself, a spot not immediately visible to passersby. During the day, the area is popular with the homeless. At night, the fortunate among them secure bed space at one of the local shelters. The unlucky ones are left to flop where they can.",
      "The beachside park closes thirty minutes after sunset and doesn\u2019t open again until 6:00 A.M. According to Municipal Code 15.16.085, it\u2019s unlawful to sleep in any public park, public street, public parking lot, or any public beach, which doesn\u2019t leave much in the way of open-air habitats available free of charge. The ordinance is designed to discourage transients from sacking out on the doorsteps of area businesses, thus forcing them to set up makeshift quarters under bridges, freeway overpasses, bushes, and other places of concealment. Sometimes the police roust them out and sometimes they look the other way. Much of this depends on whether the local citizens are feeling righteous about the poor or indifferent, as is usually the case.",
      "Preliminary examination suggested the man had been dead for close to eighteen hours by the time the coroner\u2019s investigator got in touch with me. Aaron Blumberg had been hired by the Santa Teresa County Coroner\u2019s Office in the mid-\u201970s, just about the time I left the Santa Teresa Police Department and went to work for Ben Byrd and Morley Shine. The year I opened my office, Aaron was recruited by the Kern County Sheriff\u2019s Department, from which he\u2019d recently retired. Like many law-enforcement junkies, he was ill suited for a life of leisure, and he\u2019d returned to the local coroner\u2019s office some six months before.",
      "He was a man in his sixties with a softly receding hairline. The top of his head was covered with gray fluff, like the first feathering out of a baby bird. His ears were prominent, his cheekbones pronounced, and his smile created long creases that bracketed his mouth like a marionette\u2019s. We stood in silence for a moment and then he checked my reaction. \u201cYou know him?\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t. I take it he was homeless.\u201d",
      "Aaron shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s my guess. A group of them have been congregating in that grassy patch across the street from the Santa Teresa Inn. Before that, they camped in the park adjacent to the municipal swimming pool.\u201d",
      "\u201cWho called it in?\u201d",
      "He took off his glasses and polished one lens with the end of his tie. \u201cFellow named Cross. Seven o\u2019clock this morning, he was out on the beach with a metal detector sweeping for coins. He had his eye on the sleeping bag, thinking it had been dumped. Something about it bothered him, so he went out to the street and flagged down the first black-and-white that came by.\u201d",
      "\u201cWas anyone else around?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe usual posse of bums, but by the time the paramedics arrived, they\u2019d all drifted away.\u201d He checked his lenses for smears and then resettled the glasses on his nose, tucking a wire stem carefully behind each ear.",
      "\u201cAny signs of foul play?\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing obvious. Dr. Palchek\u2019s on her way out. She has two autopsies on the books, which puts this guy at the end of the line, pending her assessment. Since Medicare went into effect, she doesn\u2019t do a post on every body brought in.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat do you think he died of? He looks jaundiced.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot to be flip about it, but what do any of these guys die of? It\u2019s a hard life. We have one just like this every couple of months. Guy goes to sleep and he never wakes up. Could be hepatitis C, anemia, heart attack, alcohol poisoning. If we can ID the guy, I\u2019ll canvas the local clinics in hopes he\u2019s seen a doc sometime in the last twenty days.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo ID at all?\u201d",
      "Aaron shook his head. \u201cNote with your name and phone number and that was it. I inked his fingers and faxed the ten-print card to the DOJ in Sacramento. Weekend\u2019s coming up and those requests are going to sit there until somebody gets around to \u2019em. Might be the middle of next week.\u201d",
      "\u201cMeanwhile, what?\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll check his description against missing-persons reports and see if there\u2019s a match. With the homeless, their families sometimes don\u2019t care enough to fill out the paperwork. Of course, it works the other way as well. Street people don\u2019t always want to be located by their so-called loved ones.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnything else? Moles, tattoos?\u201d",
      "He lifted the sheet to expose the man\u2019s left leg, which was shorter than his right. The knee cap was misshapen, raised in a thick knot like a burl. The flesh along the fibula was laced with red ropes of scar tissue. At some point in the past, he\u2019d suffered a devastating injury.",
      "\u201cWhat happens if you never find out who he is?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll hold him for a time and then we\u2019ll bury him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat about his effects?\u201d",
      "\u201cClothes on his back, sleeping bag, and that\u2019s it. If he had anything else, it\u2019s gone now.\u201d",
      "\u201cRipped off?\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s possible. In my experience, the beach bums are protective of one another, which is not to say they might not confiscate the stuff he had no further use for.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat about the note he carried? Can I see it?\u201d",
      "He reached for the clipboard at the bottom of the gurney and freed the clear plastic evidence bag in which the slip had been placed. There was a picket fence of torn paper along the top, the leaf apparently ripped from a spiral-bound pad. The note was written in ballpoint pen, the letters uniform and clean: MILLHONE INVESTIGATIONS with the address and phone. It was the sort of printing I\u2019d emulated in the fourth grade, inspired by a teacher who used a mechanical pencil and the same neat hand.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s my office,\u201d I remarked. \u201cHe must have looked me up in the yellow pages. My home number\u2019s unlisted. Wonder what a homeless guy wanted with a PI?\u201d",
      "\u201cI guess they\u2019ve got problems just like everyone else.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaybe he thought I\u2019d come cheap since I\u2019m a girl.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow would he know that? Millhone Investigations is gender neutral.\u201d",
      "\u201cGood point,\u201d I said.",
      "\u201cAt any rate, I\u2019m sorry for the wasted trip, but I thought it was worth a shot.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you mind if I ask around? Somebody must know who he was. If the guy needed help, he might have confided in his cronies.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo anything you want as long as you keep us in the loop. Maybe you\u2019ll find out who he is before we do.\u201d",

      "I sat for a moment in the parking lot, jotting notes on a succession of index cards that I keep in my bag. There was a time when I trusted more to memory. I was raised by a maiden aunt who believed in rote learning: multiplication tables, state capitals, the kings and queens of England and their reigns, religions of the world, and the periodic table of elements, which she taught me by the judicious arrangement of cookies decorated with blue, pink, yellow, and green frosting, numbers piped onto each in a contrasting color. Oddly enough, I\u2019d forgotten that particular exercise in child abuse until the previous April, when I walked into a bakery and saw a display of Easter cookies. In a flash, like a series of photographs, I saw hydrogen, atomic number 1; helium, atomic number 2; lithium, atomic number 3, working my way as far as neon, atomic number 10, before my mind went blank. I am still able to recite long portions of Alfred Noyes\u2019s \u201cThe Highwayman\u201d at the slightest provocation. In my experience, this is not a useful skill.",
      "When I was young, such pointless mental gymnastics were the perfect training for a game played at various birthday parties I attended. We were briefly shown a tray of objects, and a prize was given to the little girl who remembered the most. I was a whiz at this. In fourth grade, I won a pocket comb, a ChapStick, a small bag of marbles, a box of crayons, a nicely wrapped bar of motel soap, and a pair of plastic barrettes\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. really not worth the effort in my opinion. Eventually, mothers became annoyed and hinted broadly that I should share the bounty or cede the floor. Having a keen sense of justice even at that age, I refused, which pared down the number of invitations to zero. I\u2019ve learned in the years since that the simple expedient of written notes relieves the beleaguered child in me from burdening my brain. I\u2019m still resistant to sharing bounty I\u2019ve acquired by fair means.",
      "Pulling out of the parking lot, I thought about the oddities of life, that something as insignificant as a slip of paper could have a ripple effect. For reasons unknown, the dead man had made a note of my name and phone number, and because of that, my path had touched his. While it was too late for conversation, I wasn\u2019t quite prepared to shrug and move on. Maybe he\u2019d meant to make the call the day he died and his mortality caught up with him before he could act. Maybe he\u2019d thought about calling and changed his mind. I wasn\u2019t looking for answers, but it couldn\u2019t hurt to inquire. I didn\u2019t anticipate long-term consequences. I pictured myself asking a few questions, making little or no progress, and then letting the matter drop. Sometimes the import of a minor moment makes all the difference.",

      "On my way back into town, I stopped at the car wash. For years I owned VW Bugs, which were cheap to run and possessed a certain quirky charm. A full tank of gas would get you almost anywhere in the state, and if you suffered a fender bender, you could replace a bumper for pennies on the dollar. This more than made up for the minimal horsepower and the smirks from other drivers. I\u2019m a jeans-and-boots kind of gal myself, so the lack of glamour suited me just fine.",
      "My first VW, a beige 1968 sedan, ended up in a ditch after a fellow in a truck ran me off the road. This was out by the Salton Sea, where I was conducting a missing-persons search. The guy was intent on killing me but managed to inflict only modest damage to my person while the car was a total loss. My second VW sedan was a 1974, pale blue, with only one minor ding in the left rear fender. That car went to an early grave, shoved into a big hole after a slow-speed chase on an isolated stretch of road up in San Luis Obispo County. I\u2019ve heard that most traffic fatalities occur within a two-mile radius of home, but my experience would suggest otherwise. I don\u2019t mean to imply that the life of a private eye is all that dangerous. The big threat is my being bored half to death doing title searches at the county courthouse.",
      "My current vehicle is a 1970 Ford Mustang, a two-door coupe with manual transmission, a front spoiler, and wide track tires. This car had served me well, but the color was an eye-popping Grabber Blue, much too conspicuous for someone in my line of work. Occasionally I\u2019m hired to run surveillance on an unsuspecting spouse, and the persistent sight of a Boss 429 in close range will blow a tail every time. I\u2019d owned the Mustang for a year, and while I was no longer smitten with it, I was reconciled to Mustang ownership until the next kick-ass miscreant had a go at me. I figured I was just about due.",
      "In the meantime, I tried to be conscientious about maintenance, with frequent servicing at the local repair shop and a weekly hosing down. At the car wash for $9.99, the \u201cdeluxe package\u201d includes a thorough interior vacuuming, a foam wash, a rinse, a hot wax, and a blow dry with 60-horsepower fans. Ticket in hand, I watched the attendant ease the Mustang into a line of cars awaiting the conveyor track, which would ferry it from view. I went inside the station and paid the cashier, declining the offer of a vanilla-scented doohickey to hang on my rearview mirror. I moved over to the waiting area\u2019s long spectator window and peered to my right, watching as the attendant steered the Mustang forward until it was caught on the flat mechanical tramway. A white hatchback of unknown manufacture followed right behind.",
      "Four panels of trailing cloth bands wagged soap and water back and forth across the top surfaces of the car while whirling cloth skirts pirouetted along the sides. A separate cylinder of soft brushes caught the front grille, merrily scrubbing and polishing. There was something hypnotic about the methodical lather and rinse processes that enveloped the Mustang in a blanket of sudsy water, soap, and wax. That I considered the process enthralling is a fair gauge of how easily entertained I was at the time.",
      "I was so engrossed that I scarcely noticed the guy standing at the window next to me until he spoke.",
      "\u201cThat your Mustang?\u201d",
      "\u201cYep,\u201d I said and looked over at him. I placed him in his early forties, dark hair, good jawline, slender frame. Not so good-looking as to annoy or intimidate. He wore boots, faded jeans, and a blue denim shirt with the sleeves rolled up. His smile revealed a row of white teeth with one crooked bicuspid.",
      "\u201cAre you a fan?\u201d I asked.",
      "\u201cOh, god yes. My older brother had a 429 when he was in high school. Man, you floored that thing and it tore the blacktop off the road. Is that a 1969?\u201d",
      "\u201cClose, a 1970. The intake ports are the size of sewer pipes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019d have to be. What\u2019s the airflow rate?\u201d",
      "\u201cEight,\u201d I said, like I knew what I was talking about. I walked the length of the station\u2019s window, keeping pace with my car as it inched down the line. \u201cIs that your hatchback?\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d he said. \u201cI liked the car when I bought it, but it\u2019s one thing after another. I\u2019ve taken it back to the dealer three times and they claim there\u2019s nothing they can do.\u201d",
      "Both cars disappeared from view, and as we moved toward the exit, he stepped ahead of me and pushed open the glass door, holding it for me as I passed in front of him. One car jockey slid into the front seat of the Mustang while another took the wheel of his car, which I could see now was a Nissan. Both cars were driven out onto the tarmac, where two sets of workers swarmed forward with terry-cloth towels, wiping away stray traces of water and squirting shiner on the sides of the tires. A minute later, one of the workers raised a towel, looking over at us.",
      "As I headed for my car, the Nissan owner said, \u201cYou ever decide to sell, post a notice on the board in there.\u201d",
      "I turned and walked backward for a few steps. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been thinking about dumping it.\u201d",
      "He laughed, glancing over as a second worker nodded to indicate that his car was ready.",
      "I said, \u201cI\u2019m serious. It\u2019s the wrong car for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow so?\u201d",
      "\u201cI bought it on a whim and I\u2019ve regretted it ever since. I have all the service records and the tires are brand new. And no, it\u2019s not stolen. I own it outright.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow much?\u201d",
      "\u201cI paid five grand and I\u2019d be willing to let it go for that.\u201d",
      "By then he\u2019d caught up with me and we\u2019d stopped to finish the conversation. \u201cYou mean it?\u201d",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m open to the idea.\u201d I reached into one of the outer flaps of my shoulder bag and took out a business card. I scribbled my home phone number on the back and offered it to him.",
      "He glanced at the information. \u201cWell, okay. This is good. I don\u2019t have the money now, but I might one day soon.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d have to line up a replacement. I need wheels or I\u2019m out of business.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you think about it and I will, too. A friend of mine owes me money and he swears he\u2019ll pay.\u201d",

      "\u201cHave a good one,\u201d I said. I continued to my car and then waved as I got in. The last I saw of him, he was heading left out of the lot while I took a right.",
      "I returned to the office and spent a satisfying half hour at my Smith-Corona typing a report. The job I\u2019d just wrapped up was a work-related disability claim through California Fidelity Insurance, where I\u2019d been accorded office space for many years. Since CFI and I had parted on bad terms, I appreciated the opportunity to ingratiate myself, a reversal made possible because the executive who fired me had himself been fired. This was a gloat-worthy turn of events and the news had lifted my spirits for days. The recent job had been gratifying for more reasons than the hefty paycheck. The responsibility of an employer for the health and safety of employees is governed by state law, and the follow-up to a workplace accident usually falls to the insurance company. Not all private insurance companies write worker-comp policies, which requires a property and casualty license. In this case, the injured man was married to a CFI executive, which was why I was brought in. Being skeptical by nature, I suspected the fellow was malingering, coached by a spouse well acquainted with the means and methods for milking the situation. As it turned out, I was able to document the man\u2019s incapacitation, and his employer made sure he was afforded the benefits he was entitled to. Cynicism aside, it makes me happy when two parties, whose relationship could turn adversarial, resolve their differences to the satisfaction of both.",
      "When I finished typing the report, I made two copies on my newly acquired secondhand copy machine, kept one for my files, and put the original and one copy in an envelope that I addressed to CFI, which I dropped into the nearest mailbox as I headed for home. I was caught up on work, and for the moment I had no new clients clamoring for my services, so I\u2019d awarded myself some time off. I wasn\u2019t thinking in terms of a bona fide vacation. I\u2019m too tight with a buck to spend money on a trip and there wasn\u2019t any place else I longed to be in any event. As a rule, if I don\u2019t work, I don\u2019t eat, but my checking account was full, I had three months\u2019 worth of expenses covered, and I was looking forward to a stretch of time in which to do as I pleased.",
      "Once I\u2019d reached Cabana, I followed the wide boulevard that ran parallel to the Pacific Ocean. We\u2019d had fog and drizzle the day before and the skies were sufficiently overcast to generate a fine mist. As it happened, rainfall total for the month would later register a touch over 0.00 inches, but for all I knew, the sprinkle heralded an epic tropical storm that would soak us properly. The lingering damp suggested a change of seasons, Santa Teresa\u2019s version of summer giving way to fall.",
      "A mile farther on, at the intersection of Milagro and Cabana, I turned into one of the public lots and nosed into a parking spot that faced the Santa Teresa Inn. I figured as long as I was out and about, I\u2019d try to make contact with those who might be acquainted with the man in the morgue. This was a neighborhood I knew well, the halfway point in my usual three-mile morning jog. It was now late afternoon and the beach path was populated by a cross-flow of walkers and cyclists, tourists peddling foot-powered surreys, and kids maneuvering their skateboards as though surfing the pipeline.",
      "The homeless I saw in the early morning hours were often still huddled under a deadweight of blankets, sheltered by shopping carts piled high with their belongings. Even for nomads, the urge toward ownership is apparently irresistible. Regardless of social status, we derive comfort from our",
      "stuff",
      "; the familiar warp and weft of our lives. My pillow, my blanket, my small plot of earth. It\u2019s not that the homeless are any less invested in their possessions. The dimensions of what they own are simply more compact and more easily carted from place to place.",
      "The sun was making its slow descent and the air was getting chillier by the minute. I set my sights on a trio lounging on sleeping bags under a cluster of palms. As I watched, they passed a cigarette from hand to hand and took turns sipping from a soda can that had probably been emptied and refilled with a high-test substitute. In addition to the censure against snoozing in public, consumption of alcohol is also prohibited by municipal code. Clearly, the homeless can\u2019t do much of anything without risking arrest.",
      "It didn\u2019t take much sleuthing to locate the spot where the John Doe had been found. Just beyond a shelf of ice plant, someone had constructed a tower of carefully balanced rocks, six by my count, each stone settled on the one below it in an artful arrangement that appeared both stable and precarious. I knew the sculpture hadn\u2019t been there the day before because I\u2019d have spotted it. At the base, a motley collection of glass jars had been placed, each containing a bouquet of wildflowers or blooms confiscated from the yards of homeowners in the area. While jogging, the only way I have to keep my mind occupied is by a free-form internal commentary about external events.",
      "I focused on the three transients, two of whom were regarding me without expression. They didn\u2019t seem overtly threatening, but I\u2019m an undersize female\u2014five foot six, one hundred eighteen pounds\u2014and while capable of defending myself, I\u2019d been taught to keep my distance from any assemblage of idlers. There\u2019s something edgy and unpredictable about those who loiter with no clear purpose, especially when alcohol is folded into the mix. I\u2019m a person of order and regulation, discipline and routine. That\u2019s what makes me feel safe. The anarchy of the disenfranchised is worrisome. In this case, my wariness was superseded by my quest for information.",
      "I approached the threesome, taking a mental photograph of each in turn. A white kid somewhere in his twenties sat with his back against a palm. He sported dreadlocks. The sparse shadow of facial hair suggested he\u2019d shaved maybe once in the past two weeks. I could see a sharp angle of bare chest visible in the V of his short-sleeve shirt. The sight of his bare arms made me cross my own for warmth. His shorts seemed light for the season. The only items of substance he wore were heavy-duty wool socks and a pair of hiking boots. His legs were cute, but that was about it.",
      "The second fellow was African American, with a full head of springy gray hair, frosted with white. His beard and mustache were carefully trimmed, and he wore glasses with metal rims. He was probably in his seventies, decked out in a pale blue dress shirt under a herringbone sport coat with frayed cuffs. The third fellow sat cross-legged in the grass with his back to me, as round-shouldered and squat as a statue of Buddha. He wore an imitation leather jacket with a rip under one arm and a black knit watch cap pulled down to his brows.",
      "I said, \u201cHi, guys. I don\u2019t mean to intrude, but did any of you know the dead man who was found out there this morning in his sleeping bag?\u201d",
      "As I gestured toward the beach, it occurred to me that the detail about the sleeping bag was superfluous. How many dead men in any guise had been discovered at the beach in the past twenty-four hours?",
      "The fellow with his back to me rotated to get a good look at me and I realized my mistake. It was a woman, who said, \u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d",
      "\u201cSorry. I should have introduced myself. Kinsey Millhone. What\u2019s your name?\u201d",
      "She turned away, murmuring a four-letter word, which was audible, owing to my keen appreciation of bad language. I\u2019m occasionally rebuked for my salty tongue, but who gives a shit?",
      "The white kid spoke up in an effort to present a friendlier point of view. Without quite meeting my gaze, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s Pearl. This here\u2019s Dandy and I\u2019m Felix.\u201d",
      "\u201cNice meeting you,\u201d I said.",
      "In a gesture that I hoped would convey both goodwill and trust, I held out my hand. There was an awkward moment and then Felix got the message. He shook hands with me, smiling sheepishly, his gaze fixed on the grass. I could see grungy metal braces on his teeth. Was the welfare system in the business of correcting malocclusions these days? That was hard to believe. Maybe he\u2019d been fitted as a teen and had run away from home before his dentist finished his work. His teeth did look straight, but I questioned the wisdom of sporting orthodontia for life.",
      "Dandy, the older gentleman, spoke up, his tone mild. \u201cDon\u2019t mind Pearl. It\u2019s almost supper time and she\u2019s hypoglycemic. Brings out a side of her we\u2019d just as soon not see. What\u2019s your interest in our friend?\u201d",
      "\u201cHe had my name and phone number in his pocket. The coroner\u2019s office asked me to ID the guy, but I\u2019d never seen him before. Were you aware that he\u2019d passed away?\u201d",
      "Pearl snorted. \u201cWe look like fools? Of course he\u2019s",
      "dead",
      ". Why else would the coroner send a van? He was laying out there still as stone an hour and a half after sunup. Down here, come daybreak, you better be on the move or the cops will bust you for loitering.\u201d Her lower teeth were dark and widely spaced as though every other one had been yanked out.",
      "\u201cCan you tell me his name?\u201d",
      "She measured me, sizing up my capacity to pay. \u201cHow much is it worth to you?\u201d",
      "Dandy said, \u201cCome on now, Pearl. Why don\u2019t you answer the lady? She asked all polite and look how you\u2019re doing her.\u201d",
      "\u201cWould you butt out? I can handle this myself if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d",
      "\u201cFellow passed on. She wants to know who he is. No reason to be rude.\u201d",
      "\u201cI asked why it\u2019s any of her concern? She ain\u2019t answer me, so why should I answer her?\u201d",
      "I said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing complicated going on. The coroner\u2019s office wants to contact his next of kin so his family can decide what to do with his remains. I\u2019d hate to see him buried in a pauper\u2019s grave.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat difference does it make as long as it don\u2019t cost us anything?\u201d",
      "Her hostility was getting on my nerves, but I didn\u2019t think this was the time to introduce the notion of sensitivity training when she was already \u201csharing\u201d her feelings. She went on. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you? You a social worker? Is that it? You work for St. Terry\u2019s or that clinic at the university?\u201d",
      "I was doing an admirable job of keeping my temper in check. Nothing sets me off quicker than belligerence, warranted or otherwise. \u201cI\u2019m a private investigator. Your friend must have found my name in the yellow pages. I wondered if he\u2019d had a problem he needed help with.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all need help,\u201d Pearl said. She held out a hand to Dandy. \u201cGimme up.\u201d",
      "He stood and pulled her to her feet. I watched while she dusted imaginary blades of grass from the back of her pants.",
      "\u201cNice making your acquaintance,\u201d Dandy said.",
      "The white kid took his cue from his companions and stubbed out the last half inch of the cigarette. He stood and took one last sip from the soda can before he crushed it underfoot. He might have left it in the grass, but since I was standing right there watching him, he tucked it in his backpack like a good Boy Scout. He gathered his sleeping bag, bundled it carelessly, and secured it to his backpack with a length of rope.",
      "Clearly, our chummy conversation was coming to an end. I said, \u201cAnybody know where he was from?\u201d",
      "No response.",
      "\u201cCan\u2019t you even give me a hint?\u201d",
      "The white kid said, \u201cTerrence.\u201d",
      "Pearl hissed, trying to shut him up.",
      "Meanwhile, I was drawing a blank. \u201cWhich is where?\u201d",
      "Felix was staring off to one side. \u201cYou ast his first name.\u201d",
      "\u201cGot it. Terrence. I appreciate the information. What about his last name?\u201d",
      "\u201cHey! Enough. We don\u2019t have to tell you nothing,\u201d Pearl said.",
      "I was about to choke the woman to death with my bare hands when Dandy spoke up.",
      "\u201cYou have a business card? I\u2019m not saying we\u2019ll get back to you, but just in case.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course.\u201d",
      "I reached into my shoulder bag and took one out, which I handed to him. \u201cI jog most weekday mornings, so you can always look for me on the bike path. I\u2019m usually here by six fifteen.\u201d",
      "He examined the card. \u201cWhat kind of name\u2019s Kinsey?\u201d",
      "\u201cMy mother\u2019s maiden name.\u201d",
      "He looked up. \u201cYou happen to have any spare smokes on you?\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I said, patting my jacket as though to verify the fact. I was about to add that I didn\u2019t have any spare change either, but it seemed insulting as he hadn\u2019t inquired about my financial state. Pearl had lost interest. She grabbed her shopping cart and began hauling it toward the bike path, wheels digging into the soft grass.",
      "When it was clear the three were moving on, I said, \u201cI appreciate your help. If you think of anything useful, you can let me know.\u201d",
      "Dandy paused. \u201cYou know that minimart a block down?\u201d",
      "\u201cSure.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou pick up a couple packs of cigarettes and it might put Miss Pearly White in a mood to chat.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe can bite my big fat ass,\u201d Pearl said.",
      "\u201cThanks a bunch. Really fun,\u201d I sang as they ambled away.",
      "2",
      "I retraced my route, this time hanging a right onto Bay and then a left onto Albanil. I found a parking place two doors down from my studio and let myself in through the squeaking gate. I continued around to the backyard and skirted the flagstone patio. I unlocked my door and tossed my shoulder bag on a kitchen stool.",
      "My studio was created when my eighty-eight-year-old landlord, Henry Pitts, built a spacious new two-car garage and converted his former one-car garage into a rental unit. At the time I was looking for a place near the beach. I\u2019d been scouting the area on foot in hopes of spotting a For Rent sign when I came across the notice he\u2019d posted in the neighborhood laundromat. We met, chatted briefly, and agreed to a three-month trial period during which we could decide if the arrangement suited us.",
      "From the first, I thought he was adorable\u2014tall and lean, with bright blue eyes, a healthy head of white hair, and a wicked smile. As it turned out, Henry and I were perfect for one another, not in any romantic sense, but as good friends living close to each other. Not infrequently I\u2019m on the road for work purposes, and during the periods when I\u2019m home I tend to keep to myself. Henry is similarly self-sufficient and as committed to independence as I am. I\u2019m tidy and quiet. He\u2019s tidy and gregarious, with a strong sense of decorum, which means he minds his own business unless I\u2019m in need of a dressing-down, as is sometimes the case. He\u2019s a retired commercial baker and he was happy to have someone on whom to lavish his freshly made cinnamon rolls and chocolate-chunk brownies. Soon we were making the trek to the neighborhood tavern for dinner a couple of nights a week. He would also issue an impromptu dinner invitation when he\u2019d made a beef stew or a big pot of vegetable soup.",
      "When I first moved in, I was thirty-two years old and he was eighty-two, an age gap I considered negligible. What\u2019s fifty years\u2019 difference between friends? I\u2019ve been his tenant now for going on seven years and can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else. The only blip on the radar screen was an unfortunate incident when a bomb exploded and blew the roof off my place. Henry assumed the role of general contractor during the reconstruction, redesigning and furnishing the whole of it as though he\u2019d been doing it all his life. He fashioned the remodel after a ship\u2019s interior, complete with a porthole in the front door.",
      "Given the plunging late-afternoon temperatures, I was happy to be back in my cozy little place. The space is compact. Numerous built-in cabinets and cubbyholes provide more storage space than you\u2019d think possible. Though a mere fifteen feet on a side, the downstairs comprises a living room, a makeshift corner office, a full bath, and a five-foot bump-out to accommodate a galley-style kitchen. A small spiral staircase leads up to a sleeping loft with a Plexiglas skylight above the bed and a bathroom with a window at tub level that looks out into the trees.",
      "By way of modern conveniences, I have a stacking washer and dryer, a microwave oven, and a lightweight vacuum cleaner for my few square yards of cotton shag wall-to-wall carpet. I don\u2019t often cook, unless you want to count heating a can of tomato soup as a culinary accomplishment. Those of us who don\u2019t cook seldom have to worry about a sink full of dirty dishes, so a dishwasher would have been beside the point. After breakfast, I wash my cereal bowl and spoon, juice glass, and coffee mug, and leave them in the dish rack to air-dry until I need them again. Lunches I eat out, except for days when I take a sandwich, an apple, and cookies to munch while I\u2019m sitting at my desk. On the rare nights when I have dinner at home, I put together one of my favorite sandwiches and serve it on a folded paper towel that I can then toss in the trash. This, by the way, is yet another argument for being single. Whatever I choose to do, there\u2019s no one to complain.",
      "Henry was tied up that night, catering a small dinner party for Moza Lowenstein down the street. Rosie\u2019s Tavern was closed for the week because Rosie and William had flown to Flint, Michigan, the day before to help care for Henry and William\u2019s sister, Nell, who had undergone a second surgery on the hip she\u2019d broken in the spring. She was just getting out of rehab, and Rosie and William had agreed to be on hand until the following Friday, offering assistance when she was discharged. William is Henry\u2019s brother, older by one year. Their sister, Nell, at ninety-nine, is the oldest of the five Pitts \u201ckids,\u201d with Charlie and Lewis, ages ninety-one and ninety-six respectively, filling in the gap.",
      "An addendum to the plan was that Rosie was having her building fumigated while they were out of town. In anticipation of the process, the restaurant kitchen and storage areas had been emptied, and Henry\u2019s second and third bedrooms were now jammed with all manner of foodstuffs. I didn\u2019t inquire too closely what had motivated the purge. Rosie\u2019s devil-may-care Hungarian dishes often feature animal organs, finely minced and sauced with a slurry of alarming black specks and chewy bits. I didn\u2019t want to think about mice, weevils, and cigarette beetles.",
      "I knew Henry would report on the family drama at the first opportunity, which I anticipated in the next few days. In the meantime, I was on my own, a happy circumstance for someone of my sometimes prickly disposition. I changed into my sweats and put together a deluxe hot hard-boiled-egg sandwich and poured myself a glass of Chardonnay. After supper, I curled up on the sofa with a mystery novel until I put myself to bed.",
      "\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022",
      "The next day, Saturday, I cruised the beach area hoping to see my homeless pals. I didn\u2019t intend to make this my life\u2019s work. I thought the coroner\u2019s office had a better chance than I did of picking up a proper ID on Terrence Last-Name-Unknown. However, since I\u2019d scored the dead man\u2019s first name the day before, my modest success was now spurring me on. Pearl\u2019s antagonism was a motivating factor as well. If she\u2019d known me better\u2014or at all\u2014she\u2019d have realized that her surliness was more of a challenge than an insult.",
      "I was still debating the purchase of the cigarettes Dandy had implied might open the floodgates where Terrence was concerned. I questioned the ethics of supplying the trio with tobacco products as a means to an end. Given current scientific research, I think it\u2019s fair to point out that smoking\u2019s not a healthy practice, and I was reluctant to foster the habit among those who could ill afford it. On the other hand, as Pearl had so tartly observed in our first conversation, what business was it of mine?",
      "Having sacrificed my principles, I was left with the burning question (as it were) of which brand to buy. I had no way to evaluate the virtues of filtered cigarettes versus nonfiltered, or mentholated versus nonmentholated, so I was forced to throw myself on the mercy of the minimart clerk, who appeared to be fourteen years old\u2014too young to",
      "buy",
      "cigarettes let alone to sell them to me.",
      "I said, \u201cI could use some help here. What\u2019s the cheapest brand of cigarettes you have?\u201d",
      "He turned and picked up a pack of Carlton\u2019s, which he placed in front of me.",
      "\u201cIs this what the homeless smoke?\u201d",
      "Without a change of expression he reached under the counter and pulled out a generic brand I\u2019d never heard of.",
      "\u201cI need two more.\u201d I\u2019d already decided I\u2019d better provide a pack for each so no feelings would be hurt.",
      "He put two additional packs on top of the first.",
      "\u201cHow much?\u201d",
      "\u201cA buck nine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not bad,\u201d I said. I don\u2019t smoke myself, so I didn\u2019t know what to expect.",
      "\u201cEach.\u201d",
      "\u201c",
      "Each?",
      "Are you kidding me?\u201d",
      "He was not. I paid for the three packs and tossed them into my shoulder bag. Three dollars plus change seemed like a lot to pay, but maybe I could claim the deduction on my Schedule A when tax season rolled around.",
      "There was no sign of the threesome as I drove along Cabana Boulevard on my way home.",
      "\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022",
      "Sunday, I made another trip to the beach, my Grabber Blue Mustang attracting the usual curious stares. If my homeless friends wanted to duck me, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to do. I drove at a speed so slow it made other drivers honk. I passed the recreation center and followed the wide curve that skirted the lagoon that served as a bird refuge. I knew Pete Wolinsky had been shot to death somewhere along here, but it seemed ghoulish to park and search out the spot.",
      "I rolled through the small parking lot along the water\u2019s edge and drove back the way I\u2019d come, scanning both sides of the road. This was clearly unproductive, so I shifted to Plan B. At Milagro, I turned right and drove to the homeless shelter. Harbor House was situated in the middle of the block. The lot is narrow, the building itself set back from the street. There were eight parking spaces in front, all of them in use. A metal accordion gate had been pulled across the front door and secured with a padlock. A hand-lettered sign pasted on a side window said NA SUPPORT GROUP MEETS MONDAY AT 2:00.",
      "While Narcotics Anonymous might not meet on weekends, surely the shelter itself was open. I backed up six steps and peered in both directions. To the right of the building, a heavy-duty fence prevented passage. To the left, a double-wide drive ran between Harbor House and the service station next door. I followed the asphalt path. Tucked between the building and the drive, a stucco arch opened onto a courtyard where a small group of men and women had gathered to smoke. Landscaping was an afterthought: two palms, a few shrubs, and random patches of grass. Sand-filled coffee cans did double duty as receptacles for cigarette butts and freshly hawked-up goobers. Though I felt out of place, what worked to my advantage was that in turtleneck, jeans, and scuffed boots I looked like everyone else.",
      "A metal folding chair was planted in the archway, but no one manned the entrance and no one took notice as I crossed the patio to a door that stood open to the air. I went in, wondering if I\u2019d be asked about my reasons for being on the premises. Being rule governed, I operate in a world filled with imaginary restraints. I\u2019m happiest when signs are posted\u2014NO SPITTING, NO PUBLIC URINATION, NO WALKING ON THE GRASS. I might not obey but at least I knew where I stood.",
      "For the record, I should say this: I don\u2019t romanticize the plight of the homeless or project sentiment where none is required. My take on the indigent is that some are there because of temporary setbacks, some by default, and some for lack of an alternative. Some are needy, some are off their meds, some have opted out, some have been ousted from facilities where they might be better served. Many are there for life and not always by personal choice. Alcoholic, addicted, aimless, illiterate, unmotivated, unskilled, or otherwise unable to prosper, they sink to the bottom, and if they\u2019re down for any length of time, they lose the capacity to climb back out of the hole into which they\u2019ve fallen. If there\u2019s a remedy, I don\u2019t know what it is. From what I\u2019ve seen of the problem, most solutions perpetuate the status quo.",
      "The room I entered was large, furnished with an assortment of couches and chairs, many occupied. The foot traffic in and out was constant. A handsome gentleman in his midsixties was perched on a rolling chair behind the counter to my right. There was a woman ahead of me in this two-person line and I waited my turn. She removed a laminated card from her jeans pocket. By shifting slightly, I saw that it bore her name, an ID number, and a photo likeness.",
      "She pushed the card across the counter. \u201cHi, Ken. Could you check to see if I have mail?\u201d",
      "She leaned on the counter and peered over the edge. On the desktop below there was a ceramic mug full of toothbrushes, still sealed in cellophane packaging. \u201cCan I have one of those?\u201d",
      "By way of reply, he held up the mug and watched as she selected a red toothbrush and put it in her fanny pack. He said, \u201cI heard you were sick. Feeling better?\u201d",
      "She made a face. \u201cI was in the hospital two days. I passed a kidney stone\u2014little bitty thing about the size of a grain of sand\u2014and I\u2019m puking my guts out and shrieking like a banshee. The ER doc thinks I\u2019m faking to score a few Vicodin and that pissed me off. I raised a stink until the other doc signed an order to have me admitted. I finally got a shot of Demerol, no thanks to the asshole who turned me down.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut you\u2019re okay now?\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d feel better if my check came in. I got two bucks left to my name.\u201d",
      "He took her ID card and turned away, using his feet to scoot himself from the counter to a metal file cabinet behind him. He put the ID on top and began a finger stroll through the files. After a moment he said, \u201cNope. Not today.\u201d",
      "\u201cCan you go through the bin? Might be a big manila envelope with some other paperwork. They said it went out Tuesday, so it should be here.\u201d",
      "He leaned down to a large white plastic United States Postal Service bin, where oversize and bulky packages were lined up. He took his time, looking at the name on each piece.",
      "\u201cSorry.\u201d He rolled himself back to the counter and returned her ID. \u201cDid you talk to Lucy? She was looking for you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw her Thursday, but not since. What\u2019d she want?\u201d",
      "\u201cNo idea. You might take a look at the board and see if she left you a note.\u201d",
      "She stepped away from the counter and disappeared around the corner at the far end where the bulletin board was apparently mounted on the wall.",
      "Ken turned his attention to me. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d",
      "I toyed with the notion of a ruse, but I couldn\u2019t see the point. \u201cI\u2019m looking for information about a fellow named Terrence. I don\u2019t have his last name, but I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll know who I mean. He died a couple of days ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t give out information about our clients. The social worker might help, but she\u2019s not here today.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat about Dandy or Pearl?\u201d",
      "His expression remained neutral, as though even acknowledging the existence of a client would violate protocol. \u201cCan\u2019t help. You\u2019re welcome to come in and take a look.\u201d",
      "Surprised, I said, \u201cReally? You don\u2019t mind if I walk around?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t a private club. Anyone can join,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThanks.\u201d",
      "I circled the common room, which was spacious enough to accommodate the twenty-five people present without any suggestion of crowding. There was a big television set in one corner, but the screen was dark. There was a lone bookcase in evidence, the shelves lined side to side with an ancient-looking set of encyclopedias. One fellow had commandeered a couch for napping purposes, and he was curled up with a jacket over him. There were a few ongoing conversations, but in the main people weren\u2019t doing much. An exception was the two women who sat at either end of a Naugahyde couch with knitting projects. One unraveled row after row of a pink sweater, which shrank in her hands, reduced to a lap full of kinked yarn. The other woman struggled with size-19 needles and a ball of thick green wool. The article she was knitting was impossible to identify, something with bumps and irregular edges and holes where stitches had gotten away from her. I don\u2019t knit often these days, but I\u2019m acquainted with the perils. The same aunt who browbeat me into memorizing the rivers of the world by length (the Nile, the Amazon, the Yangtze, the Mississippi-Missouri, the Yenisey, the Yellow, on and on) also taught me to knit and crochet\u2014not for the pleasure of it, but with the intent to promote patience. This for me at age six when no child is content to sit for more than a minute at a time.",
      "More to the point here: no Pearl, no Dandy, no Felix, and I\u2019d gone as far as I could go. The dead man was dead. If he\u2019d needed my help, it was already too late to be of service. First thing in the morning I\u2019d call Aaron Blumberg and pass along what I\u2019d learned. Armed with a first name and a description of the deceased, he might track down a doctor who could fill in the blanks. \u201cA bum named Terrence with a bad limp\u201d was hardly definitive, but it was a step in the right direction. Meanwhile, my participation was at an end.",
      "3",
      "Monday, I tried three times with no luck to reach Aaron Blumberg at the coroner\u2019s office. I left messages, asking him to call me when he had a minute. I could have taken the opportunity to detail the scanty facts I\u2019d picked up, but I was hoping for a pat on the head for my resourcefulness. I spent most of the day puttering around the office, feeling distracted and oddly out of sorts. I left early, arriving home at 4:15 instead of the usual 5:00 P.M. I passed Rosie\u2019s twice in my search for a parking place and noted the building was now draped in enormous rectangular tarpaulins that were clipped together along the edges. The red, white, and turquoise stripes gave the place the look of a circus big top. I parked the car around the corner on Bay in the only semi-legal spot I could find.",
      "When I reached the backyard, Henry was hard at work in shorts, a T-shirt, and bare feet, his flip-flops tossed aside on the flagstone walk. His face was smudged with dirt, his white hair dampened by sweat, and his shins flecked with mud. His nose and cheeks were rosy from the autumn sunshine. He\u2019d apparently spent the past couple of hours aerating the lawn in preparation for overseeding the grass. Some sections he\u2019d attacked with a rototiller, then leveled the ground with a weighted roller he\u2019d rented for the occasion. A scoop of fine lawn mulch had been piled to one side with a shovel resting against the wall.",
      "He\u2019d recently acquired a cypress potting bench that was now attached to the garage. The unit boasted a zinc top and two drawers where he kept his gardening gloves and the smaller of his gardening tools. On the shelf below he\u2019d placed his galvanized watering cans and a big bag of sphagnum moss. The adjacent wall was designated for the larger tools\u2014his wood-handled garden forks, trowels, cultivators, and graduating sizes of pruning shears. Painted outlines assured that each piece would be returned to its proper place.",
      "Along with his other fall projects, he was transplanting three dozen marigolds from the original plastic commercial nursery containers to terra-cotta pots. He\u2019d already lined my modest porchlet with half a dozen of these rust-and-gold arrangements, which I thought quite festive.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve been busy,\u201d I remarked.",
      "\u201cGetting the jump on winter. Another couple of weeks we\u2019ll lose daylight savings time and it\u2019ll be close to dark by this hour. How about you? What are you up to?\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing much. I was asked to ID a guy at the morgue, but I\u2019d never seen him before.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy you?\u201d",
      "\u201cHe had my name and number on a slip of paper in his pocket. Blumberg, the coroner\u2019s investigator, assumed we were acquainted.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d",
      "\u201cWho knows? He was a homeless fellow, found dead in his sleeping bag on the beach. This was Friday morning. I\u2019ve been trying to get a line on him but haven\u2019t picked up much. Business is down so at least it gives me something to do. You need help?\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just about done with this phase, but I\u2019d love the company. I haven\u2019t seen you since, what, Thursday?\u201d",
      "\u201cYep. After Rosie and William left,\u201d I said. I set my shoulder bag on the porch and I settled on the step where he\u2019d laid his three-ring binder for ready reference. While Henry returned two pieces of lawn equipment to the garage, I spread the binder open on my lap and studied the list of items he\u2019d checked off. He\u2019d emptied, scoured, and refilled the bird feeders; harvested the last of the summer herbs for drying; pulled faded annuals from flower beds; and transplanted his perennials. He\u2019d also scrubbed and hosed off the outdoor furniture, which was currently air-drying before he stacked it in the storage shed until spring.",
      "When he reappeared, he detached a sprinkler head from the hose and began to round up the length of it in a neat coil.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d he asked.",
      "I put a tick mark by the job he\u2019d just completed. \u201cOnce you finish the lawn, all you have left is to air the wool blankets and comforters before you remake the beds. How\u2019s Nell?\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s doing well, but William\u2019s turned into a royal pain in the butt, and I mean, literally. She\u2019d been home from rehab less than an hour before he started complaining his sciatica was acting up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe has a problem with sciatica? Since when?\u201d",
      "Henry waved off the idea. \u201cYou know him\u2014highly suggestible and just a tiny bit competitive. I talked to him Friday and heard the whole tale, symptom by symptom. He said it was fortunate he\u2019d taken his cane along though it was barely adequate given the extent of his disability. He\u2019s had to borrow Nell\u2019s walker so he can hobble from place to place. He thought Rosie should rush him to the nearest emergency room, but she was busy fixing dinner, so she made Charlie take him instead. The good news\u2014or the bad, depending on your point of view\u2014is the doctor suggested an MRI and William\u2019s decided to have it done here. He says he\u2019s in dire need of a nerve specialist and asked me to set up an appointment.\u201d",
      "I said, \u201cWow. He\u2019s not due back until the end of the week. I\u2019m surprised he\u2019d put up with the delay.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, here\u2019s how it went. I started calling around, assuming it would be weeks before a slot opened up, but Dr. Metzger had a cancellation for tomorrow morning at nine. William\u2019s booked the first flight home.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat about Rosie?\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019ll stay until the end of the week as planned. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s happy to have him off her hands, and I gather the other sibs are equally relieved. They plan to teach Rosie to play bridge, which William never got the hang of anyway. He gets in at five, which means once I pick him up at the airport, I\u2019ll be at his beck and call. He claims he can barely bend over to tie his shoes.\u201d",
      "\u201cFive o\u2019clock? Great. As in thirty minutes from now?\u201d",
      "He straightened up. \u201c",
      "What",
      "time is it? It can\u2019t be that late.\u201d",
      "\u201cFour thirty-five by my watch.\u201d",
      "Henry said a word that was so out of character, I had to laugh.",
      "\u201cI can pick him up,\u201d I said, getting to my feet. \u201cIt\u2019ll give you a chance to finish your chores and take a quick shower.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hate to ask you to do that in the thick of rush-hour traffic. I\u2019ll go as I am. I don\u2019t smell that bad.\u201d He gave his T-shirt a whiff and made a show of crossing his eyes while he held his nose.",
      "\u201cThe airport\u2019s a twenty-minute drive. It\u2019s no big deal. You can pour me a glass of Chardonnay as soon as I get home.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll do better than that. I\u2019ll buy you both supper at Emile\u2019s-at-the Beach, assuming William can sit that long.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou got a deal.\u201d",

      "Construction of the Santa Teresa Municipal Airport was begun in the early 1940s and the terminal opened for business with six gates that served two national airlines and three puddle jumpers. The pint-size structure was done in the usual Spanish style\u2014a stucco exterior, a red tile roof, and a blaze of magenta bougainvillea artfully draped across the entranceway. Boarding and deplaning were accomplished on foot by way of a rolling set of stairs. Baggage claim was located outside the building in what looked like an extensive temporary carport.",
      "I pulled into the parking lot at 4:59 P.M. just as a United flight was trundling along the runway toward Gate 4. It was a small commuter craft, one of the no-frills short hops where the best one could hope for in the way of food-and-beverage service is a box containing two small pieces of Chiclets chewing gum. The flight attendant would offer the gum in a wicker basket and you were welcome to help yourself as long as you took only one. I was in no particular rush, thinking William would be last off the plane, hampered by his painful, possibly life-threatening condition.",
      "I passed through the ticketing area and out the French doors into the small grassy courtyard. I took my place near the chest-high stucco wall and watched through the length of window glass along the top as a uniformed gate agent pushed a wheelchair toward the prop jet. The engines shut down. Stairs were rolled into place. After a brief delay, the door was wrenched open, and William appeared, his cane hooked over his arm. The natural eddies of air along the runway ruffled his white hair and tugged at his suit coat. A stewardess followed in his wake, supporting him gently by the elbow as he came down the stairs. He didn\u2019t actually smack her hand, but he was visibly offended by the gesture, and he jerked his arm free. He was properly attired for travel in the same dark three-piece suit he wore for funerals and visitations. He took his time, descending the portable stairs like a toddler, first one foot down and joined by the other before he undertook the next. The remaining passengers crowded against the doorway, trying to determine what the traffic jam was about. William was not to be hurried. He was an elegant gentleman, with the same lean frame Henry had been graced with. When he reached the tarmac, he turned and waited at the foot of the stairs, leaning on his cane while the other passengers pushed past him, giving him cross looks.",
      "The pilot appeared next, carrying a bulky red canvas duffel bag with a mesh panel on each end. Behind the pilot, the copilot, or possibly the flight engineer, stepped out of the plane toting William\u2019s black rolling suitcase. Somehow he\u2019d not only claimed the right to deplane first, but he\u2019d enlisted the assistance of the entire crew. They\u2019d probably jumped at the chance to be shed of him. Whatever the motivation, William seemed to take the personal ministrations for granted.",
      "As far as I could tell, he was fine\u2014ambulatory at any rate. He had the pilot place the canvas duffel in the wheelchair, which he manned himself, pushing it toward the terminal. When he caught sight of me, he winced and placed a hand at the small of his back as though stricken with sharp pain. The copilot/flight engineer extended the handle on William\u2019s suitcase and tagged after him dutifully, pulling it along behind. As William and his merry band approached the terminal, I moved out to meet them and took over responsibility for the suitcase, murmuring my thanks to the crew.",
      "William paused and leaned his weight on the handles of the wheelchair. \u201cLet me catch my breath,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough trip. Three stops and just as many changes of aircraft.\u201d",
      "I suspected he was hoping to generate a touch of sympathy, which I offered obligingly before he could up the ante. \u201cYou must be exhausted,\u201d I said.",
      "\u201cNot to worry. I just need a moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take advantage of the wheelchair and let me push you? It\u2019ll save you a few steps.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo, no. I like to do for myself\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. while I\u2019m able,\u201d he added. \u201cYou might bring the car around. I doubt I can make it as far as the parking lot. I\u2019ll rest on one of the benches out front.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat about checked bags?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is it.\u201d",
      "I decided I might as well take the duffel as long as I was heading for the car. I could put it in the trunk and then swing around and pick him up. I grabbed the satchel by the handle and lifted it from the seat of the wheelchair. It was heavier than I\u2019d anticipated and the contents shifted as though he\u2019d packed a bowling ball without securing it properly. I said, \u201cWhoa! What have you got in here?\u201d",
      "I set it down and leaned over so I could peer through the mesh. A hissing white cat, topped with patches of caramel and black, put its ears back and spat. I jerked away, my heart hammering. This cat was the equivalent of the one in horror movies, jumping out when you\u2019re expecting the guy with the bloody butcher knife. \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d I asked, patting my chest.",
      "\u201cI brought the cat,\u201d he said complacently. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to leave it behind. Lewis was going to take it to the pound.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Talk about a cranky beast.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot as cranky as it would have been if I hadn\u2019t prevailed. I wanted to have the cat with me in the cabin, but the ticket agent refused. I knew there\u2019d be room under the seat in front of me, but she said it was the cargo hold or nothing. Her supervisor was just as argumentative until I mentioned my attorney.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy do you have a cat at all?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the stray Charlie took in months ago. Lewis has been opposed all along, which just goes to show what a heartless fellow he is.\u201d",
      "I said, \u201cAh. This is the cat Nell toppled over when she broke her hip.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, yes, but it wasn\u2019t the",
      "cat\u2019s",
      "fault. Even Nell admitted she should have watched where she was stepping.\u201d",
      "William scratched affectionately on the top of the canvas duffel, which caused the cat to rocket around the interior and then ricochet from end to end. \u201cVery playful,\u201d he remarked.",
      "The cat began to claw at the side of the carrier so vigorously, the zipper inched down a hair. I\u2019d have tugged it back into place but I didn\u2019t dare put my hand anywhere near the carrier. I didn\u2019t think the cat could reach me with its claws, but I wasn\u2019t sure the cat knew that.",
      "I returned the carrier to the wheelchair and pushed it as far as the entrance. In no way was I going to tote the cat through the parking lot to the car. I left William on a bench outside, the duffel at his feet, while I retrieved the Mustang, paid the parking fee, and brought it around to the front. William leaned over and said something to the cat, then jumped back as I had. He was apparently so caught up in the cat\u2019s playful antics that he\u2019d forgotten about his infirmity. I put his rolling bag in the trunk and wedged the cat carrier into the space behind the driver\u2019s seat while William took his place in the front, wincing in pain.",
      "\u201cAre you all right?\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t mind me.\u201d",
      "I put the car in gear and eased away from the curb. I hadn\u2019t driven ten feet before the cat let out a long continuous howl, its tone moving up and down the scale as though yodeling. \u201cDoes it always do that?\u201d",
      "\u201cOh no. Just in the car on the way to the airport and all three flights. Airline passengers can be very unpleasant when things don\u2019t go their way. The woman in front of me had a horrid little girl who screamed and cried the whole time, but did anyone complain about that? No, sir.\u201d",
      "\u201cIs it male or female?\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I think you\u2019re supposed to peek at something underneath, but the cat doesn\u2019t care for the idea. Charlie would know. He took it to the vet.\u201d",
      "\u201cDoes it have a name? Joe? Sally? That might be a clue.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe referred to the cat as \u2018the cat.\u2019 I\u2019m sure Nell or Charlie would have come up with a name, but Lewis kept threatening to toss it out and neither of them wanted to get attached. If you think about it, I saved its life, a selfless act on my part.\u201d",
      "\u201cGood for you,\u201d I said. \u201cI must say I\u2019m surprised Rosie agreed to go along with the plan. Where are you going to keep it?\u201d",
      "William and Rosie occupied a two-bedroom apartment above the tavern. I\u2019d never actually seen the place, but Henry assures me the rooms are small and dark and crowded with oversize furniture.",
      "William said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s not for me. I thought Henry would enjoy the companionship.\u201d",
      "\u201cDoes Henry know about this?\u201d",
      "\u201cNot yet.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh, boy.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou think that\u2019s a problem?\u201d",
      "\u201cFar be it from me to say.\u201d",
      "We drove for a while in silence except for the cat, which was now growling and making relentless work of canvas scratching in between thumps and flinging itself from side to side. I was trying to visualize Henry\u2019s reaction, which I knew would be genuine and heartfelt and probably high pitched. I\u2019ve never lived with a cat myself, but I\u2019d always assumed there was paraphernalia involved. I looked over at William, saying, \u201cWhat about a litter box? Isn\u2019t that where cats do their business?\u201d",
      "He blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary, do you think? Nell let it out in the backyard.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we live on a busy street. The cat will get hit by a car. Henry\u2019s going to have enough adjustments to make without the cat doing caca on his couch.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou may have a point. We better stop at the market. You can go in while I mind the cat.\u201d",
      "I think it was occurring to William that his plan was ill advised because his back problem seemed to take a sudden turn for the worse. He emitted a short yelp and sucked air through his teeth.",
      "\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to drop you at the house and come back?\u201d The minute I suggested it I knew William would be too smart to introduce the cat without someone else close at hand. Henry would tone down his response if I was present.",
      "\u201cThe pain comes and goes. Sometimes it\u2019s no more than a mild tingling or dull ache. Sometimes a burning sensation. The urgent-care doctor said it could be due to a slipped disc or spinal stenosis. I\u2019ll have to have",
      "tests",
      ".\u201d",
      "\u201cYou poor thing,\u201d I said. To William, a \u201ctest\u201d was the prelude to a terminal diagnosis.",
      "I left the 101 at Capillo and took surface streets in a zigzag detour to the nearest market. I left the howling cat in the car while William limped to and fro in the parking lot, flicking pitiful looks in my direction.",
      "I went into the store and wandered up and down the aisle devoted to pets, throwing items in my cart. The litter box was an easy choice, but there were five or six kinds of litter, and I had no idea what cats preferred in the way of toilet soil. I finally picked the one with the four cute kittens on the package. I threw in a bag of dry food with only the briefest of debates about chicken versus tuna flavors. Then I bought ten small cans of wet food, choosing items I thought I\u2019d like if I were in the cat\u2019s place, only not as hostile. I nearly stopped at the pay phone to call Henry, but he\u2019d probably assume I was playing a practical joke.",
      "Thus it was that I searched out a parking space for the second time that afternoon, this one three doors down from my studio. I put myself in charge of William\u2019s rolling bag and I even went so far as to remove the cat carrier from the backseat, lugging it in one hand as I maneuvered the rolling suitcase with the other. William held open the gate and then trailed along behind me most reluctantly, I thought. I carried the duffel as far as Henry\u2019s back door and set it down.",
      "\u201cYou can do the honors,\u201d I said. When I looked back at William, he was bent double, staring at the walk as though searching for a lost dime.",
      "\u201cBack\u2019s out,\u201d he said.",
      "Henry opened the kitchen door. \u201cGood heavens,\u201d he said as he moved to William\u2019s side. Between us, we helped him up the few shallow steps and into the kitchen. Moaning, William sank into Henry\u2019s rocking chair. I went back for the suitcase and that\u2019s when I saw the cat\u2019s paw appear through a gap where it had worked the zipper down.",
      "I\u2019ve never been present in a delivery room in the tender moment when a child is born, but I picture it much like this. The slit was no more than an inch long when the cat began to push through the opening. After the first paw, its head emerged and shortly after that, one shoulder, followed by a second white paw with a very long front leg attached. Cats are amazingly agile, as was plain to see. I watched, hypnotized, as though witnessing a miracle. \u201cHey, William?\u201d I said, but by then, the cat had wiggled free and streaked off toward the shrubs.",
      "Henry snapped to attention. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d",
      "Weakly, William said, \u201cSurprise!\u201d",
      "4",
      "Tuesday morning I rolled out of bed at 6:00, brushed my teeth, and pulled on my sweats and running shoes. A baseball cap eliminated the need to deal with my hair, which was flat on one side and standing straight out on the other. When I left the house, the only hint that the cat was still in the vicinity was a pair of mouse feet and a long gray tail on my welcome mat. I tied my key into the laces of one shoe and set out at a slow clip, hoping to warm up before I began to jog in earnest.",
      "Henry\u2019s dinner invitation from the night before had been superseded by our efforts to persuade the cat to come out of the bushes. Since William was incapacitated, it fell to Henry and me to crawl around on the newly aerated lawn, coaxing the cat with kitty treats and threats, all to no avail. Once it got dark, we\u2019d been forced to abandon the attempt and hope that the cat would at least remain where it was until morning.",
      "The day promised to be warm. In typical California fashion, the damp and chill of the week before had been replaced by temperatures slated to reach the low eighties. A lingering marine layer hovered like thick white batting, but that would burn off by midday. As though in proof of this, a column of bright yellow sunshine illuminated the ocean just offshore, looking as though a monster hole had been punched in the clouds.",
      "I completed the three-mile loop and slowed to a walk. I hadn\u2019t seen my homeless pals and I wondered how many times the notion of their whereabouts would cross my mind. It was like having a tune lodged in my head, endless replays of a melody I couldn\u2019t seem to block. The week before I\u2019d known nothing of the dead man and nothing of his friends. Now I was troubled by their absence. In deciding to dismiss the matter, I\u2019d succeeded only in tempering its effect. Terrence still hovered on the periphery while I waited for someone to step forward with a few concrete facts. I suppose I\u2019d assumed that once I knew what his story was, I could forget about him entirely and his cronies along with him.",
      "Home again, I showered, dressed, ate my cereal, and read the paper. When I left the studio, there was still no sign of Henry, William, or the cat. Either Henry had lured it inside or it had remained stubbornly out of reach. I left the mouse parts where they were in case the cat was looking forward to a snack later in the day. I hadn\u2019t even known we had mice on the property and now the population was down by one.",
      "Driving to the office, I spotted a pedestrian in a familiar herringbone sport coat poised to cross the street half a block ahead. He gave a quick look in each direction and then fixed his gaze on the sidewalk as he stepped up on the curb, heading in the same direction I was. I slowed and peered closely. Apparently, Fate wasn\u2019t done with me because sure enough, it was Dandy in baggy black trousers and a pair of bright white running shoes. I pulled over to the curb and rolled down the car window on the passenger side. \u201cDandy? It\u2019s Kinsey. You want a ride?\u201d",
      "He smiled when he caught sight of me. \u201cThat\u2019d be nice. I was on my way to your office.\u201d",
      "\u201cHop in and I\u2019ll deliver you to my door.\u201d",
      "I flipped the locks. Dandy opened the car door and slid into the passenger seat, bringing with him the cloudy smell of old cigarettes, which seemed to cling to his clothes. His pale pink dress shirt was freshly ironed and had the stiffness and sheen of spray starch. I had to guess he\u2019d spiffed himself up in anticipation of the visit. I could smell soap and shampoo and the saturated scent of alcohol wafting through his skin. It was an odd combination; his efforts at personal hygiene undercut by his habitual intake of whiskey and nicotine. I experienced a piercing sense of protectiveness because he seemed so unaware of his effect.",
      "He held up my business card. \u201cI never met a private eye, so I thought I better see for myself.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe office isn\u2019t much, but you can be the judge. I take it Pearl wasn\u2019t panting to see me again.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like to walk. Me, I hoof it all over town. I apologize for her being rude the other day.\u201d",
      "\u201cIs she always that hostile?\u201d",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t fret if I were you. It\u2019s nothing personal. Terrence was a good friend and his death was a blow. She hasn\u2019t been handling it well.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy take it out on me? I didn\u2019t even know the man.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s disputatious, though she\u2019s not as tough as she\u2019d have us believe. She may give you a hard time, but she\u2019s a pussycat at heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d",
      "I took a right turn off Santa Teresa Street onto Caballero Lane, which was one block long. My office was the center one in a line of three small stucco cottages. In addition to the cheap rent, the location was close to the heart of downtown, in walking distance of the public library, the courthouse, and the police station. I pulled up in front. There were ample parking spots available because the bungalows on either side of me were empty and had been since I moved in. Dandy got out and waited while I locked the car and joined him on the walk. He had a courtly air about him. Maybe it was the dress shirt or the hint of humor in his eyes. I thought he seemed surprisingly intelligent, and then I had to stop and correct myself. Being homeless and being smart aren\u2019t mutually exclusive states. There might be any number of reasons he was on the street.",
      "I led the way up the front steps. I unlocked the door and opened it for him. \u201cI\u2019m putting on a pot of coffee if you\u2019re interested.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d he said as he followed me in.",
      "\u201cMake yourself at home. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d",
      "\u201cThank you.\u201d",
      "I rinsed out the coffeepot and slotted it onto the machine, putting a fresh filter in the holder, which I popped into place. Over my shoulder, I could see Dandy in the outer office, where he browsed the various law books and texts in my collection, everything from",
      "California Criminal Law",
      "to a 1980 edition of the",
      "Shooter\u2019s Bible",
      ". There were also the technical tomes about burglary and theft,",
      "Scott\u2019s Fingerprint Mechanics",
      ", arson investigation, the criminal mind-set, and Adelson\u2019s",
      "Pathology of Homicide",
      ".",
      "When he drifted into the inner office, I left the coffee brewing in the kitchenette and joined him. It crossed my mind, just briefly, that he might try pilfering an item, but then I remembered I didn\u2019t have anything of value. No cash, no dope, no prescription medication, and no bottle of booze in my bottom drawer. If he wanted a ballpoint pen, I\u2019d be happy to gift him with one.",
      "He\u2019d taken a seat in one of the two guest chairs, clearly curious about my domain. I took my place on the other side of the desk and tried seeing the place through his eyes. As it happens, my office is devoid of personal touches. I have an artificial ficus tree that I think lends the room a hint of class, but the fake plant is about it. There are no family photographs, no travel posters, no bric-a-brac, and no paperweight advertising \u201cBail Bonds, Quick Response.\u201d For the most part, my desktop was clear, all of the paperwork consigned to folders tucked away in the file cabinets lining one wall.",
      "He smiled. \u201cCozy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one word for it,\u201d I said. \u201cCan I ask a personal question?\u201d",
      "\u201cAs long as I\u2019m not under oath.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was wondering what brought you to Santa Teresa.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is my hometown. I grew up three blocks from here. My father taught math at Santa Teresa High back in the forties and fifties.\u201d",
      "I made a face. \u201cMath\u2019s not my strong suit.\u201d",
      "\u201cNor mine,\u201d he replied. His smile activated dimples I hadn\u2019t noticed before. His teeth were charmingly buckled and flashed white against the dark of his complexion.",
      "\u201cDid you go to Santa Teresa High by any chance?\u201d I asked.",
      "\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I graduated class of nineteen and thirty-three, long before you were born. I attended City College for two years, but I couldn\u2019t see the point.\u201d",
      "\u201cReally? Same here. I went two semesters and then quit. Now I wish I\u2019d stuck it out, but I sure don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d",
      "\u201cBetter to get an education while you\u2019re young. My age, it\u2019s too late.\u201d",
      "\u201cHey, mine, too. Did you like school? I hated it. High school, at any rate. I was a low-waller, smokin\u2019 dope half the time.\u201d Low-wallers were the kids who loitered before and after classes on a low wall that ran along the backside of the school grounds.",
      "\u201cI was straight A\u2019s. Then life came along and I guess while you went up in the world, I went down.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call this up.\u201d",
      "\u201cUp from where I stand.\u201d",
      "I didn\u2019t know if he viewed himself as a victim or a realist. I could hear the coffee machine gurgle to a halt and I got to my feet. \u201cWhat do you take in your coffee?\u201d",
      "\u201cMilk and two sugars, please.\u201d",
      "\u201cSugar for sure. Milk could be a problem. Let me see what I can do.\u201d",
      "I left the office and went down the hall to the kitchenette, where I opened my pint-size refrigerator and gave the milk carton a sniff. Slightly off, I thought, but I\u2019ve heard that sometimes the residue of milk on the pour spout sours before the rest. I filled two mugs with coffee and added milk to mine, checking for the telltale curdling that suggests beaucoup bacteria at work. No evidence of spoilage, so I added a big dollop to his coffee and returned the carton to the fridge.",
      "I handed him his mug and two paper packets of sugar and resettled myself in my swivel chair. I held up a finger. \u201cBefore I forget\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d I leaned down and extracted the three packs of cigarettes from the shoulder bag at my feet and pushed them across the desk. \u201cConsider this a bribe.\u201d",
      "\u201cMuch appreciated. I\u2019ll pass along a pack each to Felix and Pearl.\u201d",
      "\u201cPearl, in particular. I was hoping to elevate myself in her opinion.\u201d",
      "There was a dip in the conversation. My usual practice is to let the silence lengthen until the other fellow gets squirmy enough to speak his mind. This time, I took the lead. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t walk all this way to pay a social call.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot entirely. Don\u2019t take this wrong, but your asking about Terrence really set Pearl off.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019m keenly aware. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d",
      "\u201cShe says you smell like a cop.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s because I",
      "was",
      "a cop, once upon a time. I was with the STPD two years and then I got out. I like playing by the rules when it suits, but I don\u2019t like answering to anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d he said. \u201cThen again, Terrence hadn\u2019t been dead a full day when you came sniffing around. Her words, not mine.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018Sniffing\u2019 seems an odd choice. I told you I was hoping to locate his family, which is not a federal offense. Right now, he\u2019s a John Doe. His name might be Terrence, but that\u2019s the extent of what we have. The coroner\u2019s office is swamped this week, so I said I\u2019d see what I could find out. What\u2019s she think I\u2019m up to?\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s suspicious by nature while I\u2019m the opposite. I believe most folks are honest until proven otherwise.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy policy as well,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat else is bugging her? We might as well put all our cards on the table as long as you\u2019re here.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe thinks you\u2019re not being honest about who you\u2019re working for.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat, like I\u2019m an undercover agent? I\u2019m self-employed. None of my work has anything to do with Terrence, dead or alive. You don\u2019t believe me, you can search my files.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t work for St. Terry\u2019s?\u201d",
      "\u201cNope.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not associated with the hospital or the university in any capacity at all?\u201d",
      "\u201cNo way. I\u2019m freelance. I\u2019ll swear to it,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t have clients in the medical profession or any related field. And that includes dentists and podiatrists. I don\u2019t know how else to assure you of my sincerity.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll pass that on to her.\u201d",

      "\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d",
      "\u201cGood. Then it\u2019s my turn. Why did Terrence need the services of a PI? I asked before and I didn\u2019t get an answer.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t spell out the particulars, but I know what was on his mind. He believed he had kin in the area. Growing up, he had an uncle he very much admired. The two were close when he was a kid, but he hadn\u2019t seen the man for years. Said he came to visit his uncle here shortly after the man moved to Santa Teresa. Later he heard the fellow died. He hoped to connect with family members, assuming there were any left.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe never mentioned his uncle\u2019s name?\u201d",
      "\u201cNo. I happened to overhear him talking about it to someone else.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy pick me when there are half a dozen private eyes in town?\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know a fellow named Pinky Ford?\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course. How do you know him?\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a man about town, in some sense of the word. I haven\u2019t seen him in weeks, but he lives in a big yellow Cadillac he parks here and there. Terrence was asking around and Pinky told him you were a decent sort.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to think so.\u201d",
      "Dandy cocked his head. \u201cHow do you know Pinky? He doesn\u2019t seem like your type.\u201d",
      "\u201cLong story I\u2019ll save for another time.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may take you up on it,\u201d he said. \u201cMeantime, what else can I tell you about Terrence?\u201d",
      "\u201cDo you know where he was from?\u201d",
      "\u201cBakersfield. I don\u2019t know if he was born there, but the way he told it, that\u2019s where he lived most of his life.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou met him at Harbor House?\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s right. He arrived here in January on a Greyhound bus. He\u2019d been in prison up at Soledad. He said it was a life sentence, but that\u2019s all I know. He didn\u2019t like to talk about it. He slept a couple of nights under a freeway overpass and figured out it was a bad idea. The panhandlers with cardboard signs aren\u2019t as nice as the rest of us. You stand by the road begging, that\u2019s a different work ethic. Terrence tried the Rescue Mission, but they wouldn\u2019t take him unless he swore off alcohol, which he wasn\u2019t about to do. He heard about the shelter and when he showed up, the first person he met was Pearl. She introduced him to Felix and me. Harbor House, you don\u2019t have to be sober, but you\u2019d better not be obstreperous. Make trouble and you\u2019re out.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt seems like a cool place,\u201d I said. \u201cI stopped by the day before yesterday looking for you.\u201d",
      "\u201cSunday, we throw darts. Sports bar down the block has a weekly tournament.\u201d",
      "\u201cAre you any good?\u201d",
      "\u201cDepends on what day it is and how much I\u2019ve had to drink.\u201d",
      "\u201cI noticed the woman in line ahead of me had a shelter ID card. At least I think that\u2019s what it was. I wondered if Terrence had one. I ask because he didn\u2019t have any identification on him when the coroner brought him in.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh, he had a card. I\u2019m sure of it. Harbor House issued one so he could take his meals with us. Someone walked off with all his stuff, so maybe it was in his cart.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a Harbor House resident?\u201d",
      "\u201cNot him. He didn\u2019t want a bed. Nights, he didn\u2019t like to be around other folks. He spent most his time drunk and he hung out with another fellow in the same sorry shape. Now and then he tried cleaning up his act without much success.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo he was in Santa Teresa, what, eight or nine months?\u201d",
      "\u201cSounds about right. He loved it here. He said he was never going anyplace else. March, the other fellow died and Terrence went on a bender that landed him in jail. After that he sobered up for a couple weeks. Then he started in again and one day collapsed in the street. He was lucky he didn\u2019t die that round. Pain meds and alcohol are a bad mix.\u201d",

      "Product Description",
      "POSTMORTEM The first Dr Kay Scarpetta novel which won five international awards for the best first crime novel of 1990. 'Terrific first novel, full of suspense, in which even the scientific bits grip.' The Times ALL THAT REMAINS A killer is stalking young lovers. Taking their lives and leaving just one tantalising clue . 'Another triumph for Patricia Cornwell's special brew of forensic and intuitive sleuthing.' Sunday Times Visit Patricia Cornwell's own website at www.patricia- cornwell.com",
      "From Publishers Weekly",
      "Cornwell, a former reporter who has worked in a medical examiner's office, sets her first mystery in Richmond, Va. Chief medical officer for the commonwealth of Virginia, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, the narrator, dwells on her efforts to identify \"Mr. Nobody,\" the strangler of young women. The doctor devotes days and nights to gathering computer data and forensic clues to the killer, although she's hampered by male officials anxious to prove themselves superior to a woman. Predictably, Scarpetta's toil pays off, but not before the strangler attacks her; a reformed male chauvinist, conveniently nearby, saves her. Although readers may be naturally disposed to admire Scarpetta and find the novel's scientific aspect interesting, they are likely to be put off by her self-aggrandizement and interminable complaints, annoying flaws in an otherwise promising debut. Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
      "About the Author",
      "Patricia Cornwell's first novel, POSTMORTEM was awarded a unique five international awards. Her Scarpetta series have become international bestsellers and she is also the author of PORTRAIT OF A KILLER: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed. She divdes her time between Connecticut and South Carolina.",
      "Review",
      "* 'Imitators now abound, but - pathologically speaking - nobody does it like Cornwell' - Literary Review",
      "From Library Journal",
      'This award-winning novel based on Richmond\'s real-life "South Side Strangler" case introduced Virginia\'s chief medical examiner, Kay Scarpetta, and launched Cornwell\'s career. Narrator Lorelei King generally has a pleasant reading voice and uses good pacing to build suspense. However, this is not a successful merger of book and reader for American ears. Listeners may be confused to hear that Kay wears "cocky" (khaki), for instance, and accenting the second syllable of such words as modem and condom distract the listener from the story. Furthermore, the voices of supporting characters (such as Marino, a "stoopid" New Jersey cop, and Lucy, a fussy Southern child) are stereotypical. Fortunately, an unabridged version of Postmortem is available from several other producers, including Recorded Books (Audio Reviews, LJ 2/15/94). Not recommended.?Juleigh Muirhead Clark, Williamsburg, Va.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.',

Special adaptors to allow these tapes to be played on any cassette player are available through the publisher or some US retail electronics stores.",

      "It\u2019s been said many times and many ways, but there\u2019s no place like home. A whirlwind three-year journey brought two-time GRAMMY Award-nominated songstress Lauren Daigle right back to her native Louisiana in 2017. Jumpstarted by her platinum-certified 2015 full-length debut How Can It Be, the road twisted and turned at light speed. Along the way, she gathered three Billboard Music Awards, notched an American Music Awards nomination, earned gold certifications for three singles and three K-LOVE Fan Awards. Additionally, she sold out headline tours, contributed an original composition to the critically acclaimed Blade Runner: 2049 soundtrack and touring relentlessly. The sights and sounds of her birthplace stoked this energy. Cherishing memories of attending Lafayette\u2019s Festival International every year throughout her childhood, she opened up to the gritty, organic, and handmade sounds associated with Louisiana\u2019s legendary scene. Hitting the studio with frequent collaborators Jason Ingram and Paul Mabury behind the board, she commenced work on what would become her second full-length album, Look Up Child. Track List: 1. Still Rolling Stones 2. Rescue 3. This Girl 4. Your Wings 5. You Say 6. Everything 7. Love Like This 8. Look Up Child 9. Losing My Religion 10. Remember 11. Rebel Heart 12. Inevitable 13.

      "Talk about a Collector's Edition. This one's got it all. First, a CD of the original album, remastered with bonus tracks. Next, another CD of the first live session performed by the group (May 26, 1958), plus The Den Haag Concert and The Zurich Concert (over 60 minutes of music). Then, a DVD featuring an expanded Making Of Kind Of Blue documentary, as well as the historic television program The Sound Of Miles Davis, filmed in 1959. And finally, a premium, 180-gram BLUE vinyl companion record. Plus, a hardcover book with additional memorabilia. Originally recorded in 1959, Kind Of Blue is widely regarded as the definitive jazz album, a universally acknowledged standard of excellence. It is also the best-selling jazz album of all time. Representing the pinnacle of modal jazz, Miles Davis brought together John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb and assembled one of the greatest bands in history, spontaneously inventing a new musical style and language in the process.

    description: [
      "Spieldauer: 7 Stunden und 27 MinutenHape Kerkeling, aus der Kirche ausgetretener Komiker, K\u00f6nigin-Beatrix- und Horst-Schl\u00e4mmer-Parodist, Schauspieler und (Let's Dance)-Moderator, und der Jakobsweg, einer der wichtigsten Pilgerpfade \u00fcberhaupt -- passt das zusammen? Auf den ersten Blick nicht wirklich. Kerkeling hat selbst seine Zweifel, als er sich in den Pyren\u00e4en mit seinem elf Kilo schweren Rucksack Kehre f\u00fcr Kehre in Richtung fernes Saniago de Compostela dahinschleppt. Doch im Lauf der rund 800 Kilometer langen Tour schwinden die Zweifel, sowohl beim Autor als auch beim Leser. Die beiden passen, und wie.",
      "Der Jakobsweg ist seit knapp tausend Jahren Gegenstand unz\u00e4hliger Aufzeichnungen und B\u00fccher, gerade in den vergangenen Jahren gab es eine wahre Flut zu diesem Thema. Und doch ist",
      "Ich bin dann mal weg",
      "erfrischend anders, was an der ganz und gar typisch Kerkeling'schen Art und Weise liegt, seine rund sechs Wochen lange Tour am\u00fcsant und beschwingt, aber dennoch ergreifend und sehr pers\u00f6nlich wiederzugeben. Seine ungek\u00fcnstelten Tagebucheintr\u00e4ge machen Mut, dass auch ausgewiesene Couch Potatos die durchaus vorhandenen Strapazen der Wanderung zu meistern. Strapazen lauern \u00fcbrigens auch in Gestalt wenig komfortabler Unterk\u00fcnfte, manch ungenie\u00dfbar scheinender Mahlzeit und aufdringlicher Weggef\u00e4hrten.",
      "Kerkeling nimmt alle H\u00fcrden und dabei kein Blatt vor den Mund. Er beschreibt die Dinge und Menschen, wie sie sind. Demzufolge fungiert das 320 Seiten starke und mit einigen netten Fotos angereicherte Buch als ausgezeichneter und sehr detaillierter Reisef\u00fchrer -- wenngleich sich im Vergleich zum Jahr 2001, in dem dieser Trip stattfand, sicherlich einiges ge\u00e4ndert haben d\u00fcrfte. Wichtiger noch ist aber die Funktion als vom Jakobsweg losgel\u00f6ster spiritueller Ratgeber. Das Gute daran: Das Buch will gar kein spiritueller Ratgeber sein. Missionarischer Eifer, arrogante Besserwisserei, nervige Erleuchtungseskapaden? Fehlanzeige. Und doch geht es viel um Gott, Religion, Wiedergeburt (ein Thema, dass die Boulevardpresse dankbar aufgriff) und die zentrale Frage \u0084Wer bin ich?\u0093 Seine Gedanken bringt Kerkeling in den so genannten \u0084Erkenntnissen des Tages\u0093 auf den Punkt. Kostprobe vom 3. Juli: \u0084Manchmal ist es das Vern\u00fcnftigste, einfach herrlich verr\u00fcckt zu sein!\u0093 Zum Beispiel, als untrainierter Wanderer sechs Wochen lang zu wandern.",

As they shelter from the howling gale, Roland tells his friends not just one strange story but two...and in so doing, casts new light on his own troubled past.  In his early days as a gunslinger, in the guilt-ridden year following his mother\u2019s death, Roland is sent by his father to investigate evidence of a murderous shape-shifter, a \u201cskin-man\u201d preying upon the population around Debaria. Roland takes charge of Bill Streeter, the brave but terrified boy who is the sole surviving witness to the beast\u2019s most recent slaughter.

We live for them.\u201d And indeed, the tale that Roland unfolds, the legend of Tim Stoutheart, is a timeless treasure for all ages, a story that lives for us.  King began the Dark Tower series in 1974; it gained momentum in the 1980s; and he brought it to a thrilling conclusion when the last three novels were published in 2003 and 2004.",

      "[A] phantasmagorical folk tale ... King's ability to entertain and unsettle cannot be denied. The skill with which he delivers a shock or sense of gothic terror is simply unmatched Independent on Sunday Perfectly balanced: another excellent example of King's sheer skill as a storyteller. Daily Express A frantic-paced puzzle-box adventure that encompasses gunslinger Roland Deschain's early years, werewolves and powerful storytelling. Shortlist King is one of the great popular artists of our time. Independent Like John Steinbeck, he's an unfussy writer whose voice is rooted equally in the rhythms of everyday speech and the mythic made manifest in everyday life. Indeed, reading King, you often sense the presence of the dustbowl America of The Grapes of Wrath ... a King novel has a sparse elegance that most novelists never achieve in a whole career. Put it down to the insistent, economical and wholly distinctive authorial voice. SFX Magazine Classic King, fine characters, compellingly written in a gripping, well-honed plot Daily Express on WOLVES OF THE CALLA Superbly energetic, it's King at his best.

      "The Wind through the Keyhole: A Dark Tower Novel",
      "by Stephen King",
      "FOREWORD",
      "Most of the people holding this book have followed the adventures of Roland and his band\u2014his ka-tet\u2014for years, some of them from the very beginning. Others\u2014and I hope there are many, newcomers and Constant Readers alike\u2014may ask,",
      "Can I read and enjoy this",
      "story if I haven\u2019t read the other Dark Tower books?",
      "My answer is yes, if you keep a few things in mind.",
      "First, Mid-World lies next to our world, and there are many overlaps. In some places there are doorways between the two worlds, and sometimes there are thin places, porous places, where the two worlds actually mingle. Three of Roland\u2019s ka-tet\u2014Eddie, Susannah, and Jake have been drawn separately from troubled lives in New York into Roland\u2019s Mid-World quest. Their fourth traveling companion, a billy-bumbler named Oy, is a golden-eyed creature native to Mid-World. Mid-World is very old, and falling to ruin, filled with monsters and untrustworthy magic.",
      "Second, Roland Deschain of Gilead is a gunslinger\u2014one of a small band that tries to keep order in an increasingly lawless world. If you think of the gunslingers of Gilead as a strange combination of knights errant and territorial marshals in the Old West, you\u2019ll be close to the mark. Most of them, although not all, are descended from the line of the old White King, known as Arthur Eld (I told you there were overlaps).",
      "Third, Roland has lived his life under a terrible curse. He killed his mother, who was having an affair\u2014mostly against her will, and certainly against her better judgment\u2014with a fellow you will meet in these pages. Although it was by mistake, he holds himself accountable, and the unhappy Gabrielle Deschain\u2019s death has haunted him since his young manhood. These events are fully narrated in the Dark Tower cycle, but for our purposes here, I think it\u2019s all you have to know.",

      "\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about him?\u201d Susannah asked Roland. \u201cOut there on his own?\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got Oy with him,\u201d Eddie said, referring to the billy-bumbler who had adopted Jake as his special friend. \u201cMr. Oy gets along with nice folks all right, but he\u2019s got a mouthful of sharp teeth for those who aren\u2019t so nice. As that guy Gasher found out to his sorrow.\u201d",

      "\u201cSorry,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cPublic Works hasn\u2019t been doing any maintenance along this stretch of the turnpike lately. Must be dealing with budget cuts.\u201d",

Earlier that morning they had even passed an abandoned store with a barely readable sign: TOOK\u2019S OUTLAND MERCANTILE. They investigated inside for supplies\u2014Jake and Oy had still been with them then\u2014and had found nothing but dust, ancient cobwebs, and the skeleton of what had been either a large raccoon, a small dog, or a billy-bumbler. Oy had taken a cursory sniff and then pissed on the bones before leaving the store to sit on the hump in the middle of the old road with his squiggle of a tail curled around him. He faced back the way they had come, sniffing the air.",
      "Roland had seen the bumbler do this several times lately, and although he had said nothing, he pondered it. Someone trailing them, maybe? He didn\u2019t actually believe this, but the bumbler\u2019s posture\u2014nose lifted, ears pricked, tail curled\u2014called up some old memory or association that he couldn\u2019t quite catch.",
      "\u201cWhy does Jake want to be on his own?\u201d Susannah asked.",
      "\u201cDo you find it worrisome, Susannah of New York?\u201d Roland asked.",
      "\u201cYes, Roland of Gilead, I find it",
      "worrisome.",
      "\u201d She smiled amiably enough, but in her eyes, the old mean light sparkled. That was the Detta Walker part of her, Roland reckoned. It would never be completely gone, and he wasn\u2019t sorry. Without the strange woman she had once been still buried in her heart like a chip of ice, she would have been only a handsome black woman with no legs below the knees. With Detta onboard, she was a person to be reckoned with. A dangerous one. A gunslinger.",
      "\u201cHe has plenty of stuff to think about,\u201d Eddie said quietly. \u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot. Not every kid comes back from the dead. And it\u2019s like Roland says\u2014if someone tries to face him down, it\u2019s the someone who\u2019s apt to be sorry.\u201d Eddie stopped pushing the wheelchair, armed sweat from his brow, and looked at Roland. \u201c",
      "Are",
      "there someones in this particular suburb of nowhere, Roland? Or have they all moved on?\u201d",
      "\u201cOh, there are a few, I wot.\u201d",
      "He did more than wot; they had been peeked at several times as they continued their course along the Path of the Beam. Once by a frightened woman with her arms around two children and a babe hanging in a sling from her neck. Once by an old farmer, a half-mutie with a jerking tentacle that hung from one corner of his mouth. Eddie and Susannah had seen none of these people, or sensed the others that Roland felt sure had, from the safety of the woods and high grasses, marked their progress. Eddie and Susannah had a lot to learn.",
      "But they had learned at least some of what they would need, it seemed, because Eddie now asked, \u201cAre they the ones Oy keeps scenting up behind us?\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Roland thought of adding that he was sure something else was on Oy\u2019s strange little bumbler mind, and decided not to. The gunslinger had spent long years with no ka-tet, and keeping his own counsel had become a habit. One he would have to break, if the tet was to remain strong. But not now, not this morning.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s move on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find Jake waiting for us up ahead.\u201d",
      "Two hours later, just shy of noon, they breasted a rise and halted, looking down at a wide, slow-moving river, gray as pewter beneath the overcast sky. On the northwestern bank\u2014their side\u2014was a barnlike building painted a green so bright it seemed to yell into the muted day. Its mouth jutted out over the water on pilings painted a similar green. Docked to two of these pilings by thick hawsers was a large raft, easily ninety feet by ninety, painted in alternating stripes of red and yellow. A tall wooden pole that looked like a mast jutted from the center, but there was no sign of a sail. Several wicker chairs sat in front of it, facing the shore on their side of the river. Jake was seated in one of these. Next to him was an old man in a vast straw hat, baggy green pants, and longboots. On his top half he wore a thin white garment\u2014the kind of shirt Roland thought of as a slinkum. Jake and the old man appeared to be eating well-stuffed popkins. Roland\u2019s mouth sprang water at the sight of them.",

So when it's time for her medicine, George concocts a bubbling, frothing, marvellous mixture, which is guaranteed to send her through the roof . . .",
      "From Publishers Weekly",
      "Knopf includes George's Marvelous Medicine and Fantastic Mr. Fox in its roster of handsomely redesigned hardcover Roald Dahl reissues. In the first novel, George comes up with a potion to improve the mood of his grumpy grandma; the second centers on the efforts of farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean to catch the titular thief. Both feature Quentin Blake's original illustrations and include an interview with the author. (June) Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

      "On Saturday morning George is stuck with looking after his ancient, incredibly mean grandmother. As the old woman alternately insults and scares him, George decides to give her a new kind of medicine. Using every liquid, powder, and pill he can find, George makes a concoction destined to change the family and several hens. Richard E. Grant fluidly changes from a good-natured boy pushed too far to the nastiest old lady imaginable to a hyperactive father with a brogue to a sensible mother wanting only peace and quiet. The written story is fun. The story as performed by Grant is marvelous. J.M.P. \u00a9 AudioFile 2003, Portland, Maine--",

      'Gr 4\u20137\u2014George\'s grandmother is a terribly grumpy, "grizzly old grunion" who just loves to order young George around. George decides he will create a medicine to relieve Grandma of all of her awfulness. Adding everything he can find in the house and barn, including shampoo, shaving cream, animal medicines, shoe polish, and paint, George boils up a pot of medicine that has shocking results when given to Grandma. Utter chaos breaks out when his father determines that they should brew up more of the awful stuff to give to the farmyard animals and George can\'t quite remember exactly what he used the first time around. Derek Jacobi does a commendable job voicing the quirky characters; Grandma is perfectly grating and nasty. The pacing is just right for the wacky presentation, and Jacobi nicely captures the complete pandemonium as things spiral out of control. This is a quick listen and should appeal to fans of Dahl although it may leave some adults feeling squeamish and grateful for the warning to "not try this at home" found at the beginning of the presentation.\u2014Deanna Romriell, Salt Lake City Public Library, UT',

      "This was a silly thing to say to a small boy at any time. It immediately made him wonder what sort of mischief he might get into.",

His father was a farmer, and the farm they lived on was miles away from anywhere, so there were never any children to play with. He was tired of staring at pigs and hens and cows and sheep. He was especially tired of having to live in the same house as that grizzly old grunion of a grandma. Looking after her all by himself was hardly the most exciting way to spend a Saturday morning.",
      "\u201cYou can make me a nice cup of tea for a start,\u201d Grandma said to George. \u201cThat\u2019ll keep you out of mischief for a few minutes.\u201d",
      "\u201cYes, Grandma,\u201d George said.",
      "George couldn\u2019t help disliking Grandma. She was a selfish grumpy old woman. She had pale brown teeth and a small puckered-up mouth like a dog\u2019s bottom.",
      "\u201cHow much sugar in your tea today, Grandma?\u201d George asked her.",
      "\u201cOne spoonful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd no milk.\u201d",
      "Most grandmothers are lovely, kind, helpful old ladies, but not this one. She spent all day and every day sitting in her chair by the window, and she was always complaining, grousing, grouching, grumbling, griping about something or other. Never once, even on her best days, had she smiled at George and said, \u201cWell, how are you this morning, George?\u201d or, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you and I have a game of Snakes and Ladders?\u201d or, \u201cHow was school today?\u201d She didn\u2019t seem to care about other people, only about herself. She was a miserable old grouch.",
      "George went into the kitchen and made Grandma a cup of tea with a teabag. He put one spoon of sugar in it and no milk. He stirred the sugar well and carried the cup into the living room.",
      "Grandma sipped the tea. \u201cIt\u2019s not sweet enough,\u201d she said. \u201cPut more sugar in.\u201d",
      "George took the cup back to the kitchen and added another spoonful of sugar. He stirred it again and carried it carefully in to Grandma.",
      "\u201cWhere\u2019s the saucer?\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t have a cup without a saucer.\u201d",
      "George fetched her a saucer.",

      "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of",
      "3:10 to Yuma",
      "leads some moviegoers to check out",
      "Delmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original",
      '. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on "duty," and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.',
      "All of the above applies in the new",
      "3:10",
      ", but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)",
      "Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.",

      "MacKayla Lane\u2019s life is good. She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she\u2019s your perfectly ordinary twenty-first-century woman. Or so she thinks\u2026until something extraordinary happens. When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death - a cryptic message on Mac\u2019s cell phone - Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister\u2019s killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed - a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae\u2026 As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister\u2019s death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane - an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women - closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac\u2019s true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book - because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands\u2026",

As he shows, it's really the things you love that define who you are and so Graham tells his story from childhood to present day, describing just what and who he loved - and sometimes lost - as a child, and how he has discovered and rediscovered new loves and obsessions - big and small - as he's grown older. From dogs and boys to Dolly Parton and Ireland Graham tells his life and loves with characteristic humour and outrageous candour.",

      "Bill Bryson's first travel book, The Lost Continent, was unanimously acclaimed as one of the funniest books in years. In Neither here Nor there he brings his unique brand of humour to bear on Europe as he shoulders his backpack, keeps a tight hold on his wallet, and journeys from Hamemrfest, the northernmost town on the continent, to istanbul on the cusp of Asia. Fluent in, oh, at least one language, he retraces his travels as a student twenty years before. Whether braving the homicidal motorists of Paris, being robbed by gypsies in Florence, attempting not to order tripe and eyeballs in a German restaurant, window-shopping in the sex shops of the Reeperbahn or disputing his hotel bill in Copenhagen, Bryson takes in the sights, dissects the culture and illuminates each place and person with his hilariously caustic observations. He even goes to Liechtenstein.",

      "To hear this powerful story read by the woman who lived it is a life-changing experience. Ali survived civil war and mutilation to become an international spokeswoman for Islamic reform, especially with respect to womens rights. Her escape from Saudi Arabia and Somalia to the free-thinking Netherlands is stark in its incomprehensible contrasts and sometimes darkly amusing in its misunderstandings of cultural differences. Ali earned a political science degree and became the first Muslim member of the Dutch parliament. She worked with Theo Van Gogh on the film SUBMISSION before he was assassinated by a fanatical Muslim terrorist who objected to the film. Alis thick accent makes some words unintelligible, but her acuity and vigor counterbalance this to make the listener all the more in awe of her.",

    description: [
      "The long-awaited new novel from Margaret Atwood. The Year of the Flood is a dystopic masterpiece and a testament to her visionary power. The times and species have been changing at a rapid rate, and the social compact is wearing as thin as environmental stability. Adam One, the kindly leader of the God's Gardeners--a religion devoted to the melding of science and religion, as well as the preservation of all plant and animal life--has long predicted a natural disaster that will alter Earth as we know it. Now it has occurred, obliterating most human life. Two women have survived: Ren, a young trapeze dancer locked inside the high-end sex club Scales and Tails, and Toby, a God's Gardener barricaded inside a luxurious spa where many of the treatments are edible. Have others survived? Ren's bioartist friend Amanda? Zeb, her eco-fighter stepfather? Her onetime lover, Jimmy? Or the murderous Painballers, survivors of the mutual-elimination Painball prison? Not to mention the shadowy, corrupt policing force of the ruling powers... Meanwhile, gene-spliced life forms are proliferating: the lion/lamb blends, the Mo'hair sheep with human hair, the pigs with human brain tissue. As Adam One and his intrepid hemp-clad band make their way through this strange new world, Ren and Toby will have to decide on their next move. They can't stay locked away... By turns dark, tender, violent, thoughtful, and uneasily hilarious, The Year of the Flood is Atwood at her most brilliant and inventive.",

      "The late founder of the Wal-Mart chain describes how he turned a single dime store into the world's largest retail operation. As Sam Walton himself said, this is \"...a story about entrepreneurship, and risk, and hard work, and knowing where you want to go and being willing to do what it takes to get there. And it's a story about believing in your idea even when maybe some other folks don't, and about sticking to your guns.\" It's the story of how Walton parlayed a single dime store in a hardscrabble cotton town into Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world. The undisputed merchant king of the late twentieth century, he never lost the common touch. Here Walton tells his extraordinary story in his own inimitable words. Genuinely modest, but always sure of his ambitions and achievements, Walton shares his thinking in a candid, straight-from-the-shoulder style.",

      "Recorded in November 1993, less than six months before singer Kurt Cobain killed himself, Nirvana's MTV Unplugged is a watershed document that presents a band at the peak of its powers. Unlike any other unplugged affair, the diverse album is not a simple stripped-down regurgitation of greatest hits or a cash-it-in set of nostalgic favorites. Rather, the live effort is among the most emotionally naked spectacles ever released an album so starkly intense and profoundly personal, it's impossible not to get chills down the spine. Track List: 1. About A Girl 2. Come as You Are 3. Jesus Doesn't Want Me for A Sunbeam 4. The Man Who Sold the World 5. Pennyroyal Tea 6. Dumb 7. Polly 8. On A Plain 9. Something in The Way 10.

      "Easily The Biggest SACD Title in The Analogue Productions Catalog! A multitrack masterpiece. Mixed for 5.1 surround sound and stereo from the original analog master tapes by Pink Floyd Producer/Engineer James Guthrie One of the biggest SACD reissues in the history of the format \u2014 back in print Wish You Were Here(?) Now you can be. Total lifelike recreation of a chart-topping, pioneering, way-ahead-of-its-time blockbuster. You talk about a title made for multichannel SACD! It's as if they knew at the album's creation that this format would be available. Finally, technology caught up with Pink Floyd. And oh how lucky we all are to still be around to hear this legendary studio recording in its full potential. Pink Floyd chose Acoustic Sounds and Analogue Productions to handle the exclusive distribution of this monumental SACD and we are honored and thrilled to be a part of the huge Why Pink Floyd...? campaign that includes remastered CDs, Blu-rays, DVDs, LPs, memorabilia box sets and this, the first-ever multichannel presentation of Wish You Were Here. The SACD also of course includes a stunning stereo mix. And as this is a hybrid disc, the record is of course also playable on a standard CD player. On its release in 1975 Wish You Were Here topped the album charts in both the U.K. and the U.S. Reflecting the band's thoughts of the time on the music business and exploring themes of absence, Wish You Were Here contains the classic cut \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\" a tribute to founding band member Syd Barrett. In fact, Barrett, who'd long been absent from the lives of Pink Floyd's band members, stopped by the Wish You Were Here recording sessions at London's Abbey Road Studios unannounced. The reunion \u2014 with Barrett reportedly appearing in poor mental condition \u2014 is said to have been an emotionally stirring event for the band, and apparently that encounter would be the last any of the band members were ever to see of Barrett, who died in 2006. As they did with their previous release, Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd made great use of studio effects for this, their ninth album overall. The record's winding soundscapes are perfect for the canvas of multichannel SACD. Spacious and airy, the record breathes like a living being. Wish You Were Here was selected by Rolling Stone as No. 209 on their list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". And that's before they heard it like this! 5.1 surround mix by James Guthrie Assistant engineer Joel Plante Mastered by James Guthrie and Joel Plante Mixed and mastered at das boot recording DSD authoring for SACD by Gus Skinas \"...Analogue Productions got the exclusive for the latter's appearance in 5.1 on SACD. The results are spectacular, given that the progressive rock of the day - this dates from 1975 - was conceived from the outset to immerse the listener in sound. Regardless of its surround sound aspect, this is a dazzling effort...today's discrete multichannel capabilities truly liberate the sound in all of its open and spacious glory.\" Sound Quality: 92% \u2014 Ken Kessler, Hi Fi News, February 2012 \"The Analogue Productions SACD of Wish You Were Here offers a premium quality compact package and the rapturous sound quality of high resolution audio...For Pink Floyd Fans, Wish You Were Here represents the perfect synergy of sonic perfection, lyrical emotion and instrumental proficiency. Deservedly so, Wish You Were Here now joins Dark Side Of The Moon on the Super Audio CD format, offering Pink Floyd fans the quintessential audiophile listening experience. Highly recommended!\" \u2014 Paul Powell Jr., Brain Damage, December 2011",

    description: [
      '"The greatest writer of historical adventures today" (Washington Post) tackles his richest, most thrilling subject yet--the heroic tale of Agincourt. Young Nicholas Hook is dogged by a cursed past--haunted by what he has failed to do and banished for what he has done. A wanted man in England, he is driven to fight as a mercenary archer in France, where he finds two things he can love: his instincts as a fighting man, and a girl in trouble. Together they survive the notorious massacre at Soissons, an event that shocks all Christendom. With no options left, Hook heads home to England, where his capture means certain death. Instead he is discovered by the young King of England--Henry V himself--and by royal command he takes up the longbow again and dons the cross of Saint George. Hook returns to France as part of the superb army Henry leads in his quest to claim the French crown. But after the English campaign suffers devastating early losses, it becomes clear that Hook and his fellow archers are their king\'s last resort in a desperate fight against an enemy more daunting than they could ever have imagined. One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare in Henry V--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry\'s hands. Here Bernard Cornwell resurrects the legend of the battle and the "band of brothers" who fought it on October 25, 1415. An epic of redemption, Agincourt follows a commoner, a king, and a nation\'s entire army on an improbable mission to test the will of God and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. From the disasters at the siege of Harfleur to the horrors of the field of Agincourt, this exhilarating story of survival and slaughter is at once a brilliant work of history and a triumph of imagination\u2014Bernard Cornwell at his best.',

      "Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard - By Chip Heath (A);Dan Heath(A); Charles Kahlenberg (N)",

    description: [
      "Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our companies, in our communities, and in our own lives? The primary obstacle is a conflict that\u2019s built into our brains, say Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the critically acclaimed bestseller Made to Stick. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems\u2014the rational mind and the emotional mind\u2014that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort\u2014but if it is overcome, change can come quickly. In Switch, the Heaths show how everyday people\u2014employees and managers, parents and nurses\u2014have united both minds and, as a result, achieved dramatic results: \u25cf The lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched, decades-old medical practice that was endangering patients. \u25cf The home-organizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping. \u25cf The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customer-support team into service zealots by removing a standard tool of customer service In a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change. Switch shows that successful changes follow a pattern, a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you, whether your interest is in changing the world or changing your waistline.",

      "It may surprise some to realize that Guns N' Roses released only four full-length original albums, and two of those debuted simultaneously. But they were enough to forever change rock 'n' roll. Even more shocking is that one of the great bands in rock history, with its last studio album issued 10 years ago, has never had a \"best of\" compilation. Now it has. Welcome to the jungle with Greatest Hits (Geffen), released March 23, 2004. With 14 selections housed in a digipak, Greatest Hits features all eight of the band's Top 40 Billboard Hot 100 tracks (five of them RIAA-certified \"gold,\" i.e., sales of more than 500,000 units). Along with spanning the group's five album releases, Greatest Hits also marks the debut on a Guns N' Roses album of the band's cover of the Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" for the 1995 film Interview with the Vampire.  Track List:  1. Welcome to The Jungle 2. Sweet Child O' Mine 3. Patience 4. Paradise City 5. Knockin' on Heaven's Door 6. Civil War 7. You Could Be Mine 8. Don't Cry Original 9. November Rain 10.

Many of de Cuir's declarative sentences end in a questioning tone, her dialogue is flat, and her characters are difficult to distinguish. Several passages were enhanced by the lightest touch of music. Part of LeGuin's Earthsea Cycle, this book provides the jumping-off point into unknown worlds for many fantasy readers and deserves a more animated reader.

      "Chapter One: The Eaten One",
      "One high horn shrilled and ceased. The silence that followed was shaken only by the sound of many footsteps keeping time with a drum struck softly at a slow heart-pace. Through cracks in the roof of the Hall of the Throne, gaps between columns where a whole section of masonry and tile had collapsed, unsteady sunlight shone aslant. It was an hour after sunrise. The air was still and cold. Dead leaves of weeds that had forced up between marble pavement-tiles were outlined with frost, and crackled, catching on the long black robes of the priestesses.",
      "They came, four by four, down the vast hall between double rows of columns. The drum beat dully. No voice spoke, no eye watched. Torches carried by black-clad girls burned reddish in the shafts of sunlight, brighter in the dusk between. Outside, on the steps of the Hall of the Throne, the men stood, guards, trumpeters, drummers; within the great doors only women had come, dark-robed and hooded, walking slowly four by four towards the empty throne.",
      "Two came, tall women looming in their black, one of them thin and rigid, the other heavy, swaying with the planting of her feet. Between these two walked a child of about six. She wore a straight white shift. Her head and arms and legs were bare, and she was barefoot. She looked extremely small. At the foot of the steps leading up to the throne, where the others now waited in dark rows, the two tall women halted. They pushed the child forward a little.",
      "The throne on its high platform seemed to be curtained on each side with great webs of blackness dropping from the gloom of the roof; whether these were curtains, or only denser shadows, the eye could not make certain. The throne itself was black, with a dull glimmer of precious stones or gold on the arms and back, and it was huge. A man sitting in it would have been dwarfed; it was not of human dimensions. It was empty. Nothing sat in it but shadows.",
      "Alone, the child climbed up four of the seven steps of red-veined marble. They were so broad and high that she had to get both feet onto one step before attempting the next. On the middle step, directly in front of the throne, stood a large, rough block of wood, hollowed out on top. The child knelt on both knees and fitted her head into the hollow, turning it a little sideways. She knelt there without moving.",
      "A figure in a belted gown of white wool stepped suddenly out of the shadows at the right of the throne and strode down the steps to the child. His face was masked with white. He held a sword of polished steel five feet long. Without word or hesitation he swung the sword, held in both hands, up over the little girl's neck. The drum stopped beating.",
      "As the blade swung to its highest point and poised, a figure in black darted out from the left side of the throne, leapt down the stairs, and stayed the sacrificer's arms with slenderer arms. The sharp edge of the sword glittered in mid-air. So they balanced for a moment, the white figure and the black, both faceless, dancer-like above the motionless child whose white neck was bared by the parting of her black hair.",
      "In silence each leapt aside and up the stairs again, vanishing in the darkness behind the enormous throne. A priestess came forward and poured out a bowl of liquid on the steps beside the kneeling child. The stain looked black in the dimness of the hall.",
      "The child got up and descended the four stairs laboriously. When she stood at the bottom, the two tall priestesses put on her a black robe and hood and mantle, and turned her around again to face the steps, the dark stain, the throne.",
      '"O let the Nameless Ones behold the girl given to them, who is verily the one born ever nameless. Let them accept her life and the years of her life until her death, which is also theirs. Let them find her acceptable. Let her be eaten!"',
      'Other voices, shrill and harsh as trumpets, replied: "She is eaten! She is eaten!"',
      "The little girl stood looking from under her black cowl up at the throne. The jewels inset in the huge clawed arms and the back were glazed with dust, and on the carven back were cobwebs and whitish stains of owl droppings. The three highest steps directly before the throne, above the step on which she had knelt, had never been climbed by mortal feet. They were so thick with dust that they looked like one slant of gray soil, the planes of the red-veined marble wholly hidden by the unstirred, untrodden siftings of how many years, how many centuries.",
      '"She is eaten! She is eaten!"',
      "Now the drum, abrupt, began to sound again, beating a quicker pace.",
      "Silent and shuffling, the procession formed and moved away from the throne, eastward towards the bright, distant square of the doorway. On either side, the thin double columns, like the calves of immense pale legs, went up to the dusk under the ceiling. Among the priestesses, and now all in black like them, the child walked, her small bare feet treading solemnly over the frozen weeds, the icy stones. When sunlight slanting through the ruined roof flashed across her way, she did not look up.",
      "Guards held the great doors wide. The black procession came out into the thin, cold light and wind of early morning. The sun dazzled, swimming above the eastern vastness. Westward, the mountains caught its yellow light, as did the fa\u00c7ade of the Hall of the Throne. The other buildings, lower on the hill, still lay in purplish shadow, except for the Temple of the God-Brothers across the way on a little knoll: its roof, newly gilt, flashed the day back in glory. The black line of the priestesses, four by four, wound down the Hill of the Tombs, and as they went they began softly to chant. The tune was on three notes only, and the word that was repeated over and over was a word so old it had lost its meaning, like a signpost still standing when the road is gone. Over and over they chanted the empty word. All that day of the Remaking of the Priestess was filled with the low chanting of women's voices, a dry unceasing drone.",
      "The little girl was taken from room to room, from temple to temple. In one place salt was placed upon her tongue; in another she knelt facing west while her hair was cut short and washed with oil and scented vinegar; in another she lay face down on a slab of black marble behind an altar while shrill voices sang a lament for the dead. Neither she nor any of the priestesses ate food or drank water all that day. As the evening star set, the little girl was put to bed, naked between sheepskin rugs, in a room she had never slept in before. It was in a house that had been locked for years, unlocked only that day. The room was higher than it was long, and had no windows. There was a dead smell in its, still and stale. The silent women left her there in the dark.",
      "She held still, lying just as they had put her. Her eyes were wide open. She lay so for a long time.",
      'She saw light shake on the high wall. Someone came quietly along the corridor, shielding a rushlight so it showed no more light than a firefly. A husky whisper: "Ho, are you there, Tenar?"',
      "The child did not reply.",
      "A head poked in the doorway, a strange head, hairless as a peeled potato, and of the same yellowish color. The eyes were like potato-eyes, brown and tiny. The nose was dwarfed by great, flat slabs of cheek, and the mouth was a lipless slit. The child stared unmoving at this face. Her eyes were large, dark, fixed.",
      "\"Ho, Tenar, my little honeycomb, there you are!\" The voice was husky, high as a woman's voice but not a woman's voice. \"I shouldn't be here, I belong outside the door, on the porch, that's where I go. But I had to see how my little Tenar is, after all the long day of it, eh, how's my poor little honeycomb?\"",
      "He moved towards her, noiseless and burly, and put out his hand as if to smooth back her hair.",
      '"I am not Tenar any more," the child said, staring up at him. His hand stopped; he did not touch her.',
      '"No," he said, after a moment, whispering. "I know. I know. Now you\'re the little Eaten One. But I\u0160"',
      "She said nothing.",
      '"It was a hard day for a little one," the man said, shuffling the tiny light flickering in his big yellow hand.',
      '"You should not be in this house, Manan."',
      '"No. No. I know. I shouldn\'t be in this House. Well, good night, little one\u0160 Good night."',
      "The child said nothing. Manan slowly turned around and went away. The glimmer died from the high cell walls. The little girl, who had no name any more but Ahra, the Eaten One, lay on her back looking steadily at the dark.",

      "Import version. Midnight Memories, the new album from One Direction is a record which documents just how far they've come in the music industry. It's an album which, the boys themselves confess, has opened up a bigger creative role for them individually allowing them all to co-write most of the 14 tracks and once again work with some well-respected songwriters. Joining them on this record are Julian Bunetta (Olly Murs, Leona Lewis, JLS), Jamie Scott (Enrique Iglesias, JLS, Little Mix) and Jacknife Lee (Blur, Robbie Williams, Biffy Clyro) as well as international artists with song-writing credits of their own such as Tom Fletcher, Danny Jones and Dougie Poynter from McFly, One Republic's Ryan Tedder and Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody. An impressive line-up. In just one listen, it's clear the new tracks are more mature, more honest and more indicative of the boys' lives. They tell the story of their journeys across the world, of being away from home, falling in love and the opportunity they ve been given.Track List: 1. Best Song Ever 2. Story of My Life 3. Diana 4. Midnight Memories 5. You & I 6. Don't Forget Where You Belong 7. Strong 8. Happily 9. Right Now 10. Little Black Dress 11. Through the Dark 12. Something Great 13. Little White Lies 14.

    description: [
      "Born mute, speaking only in sign, Edgar Sawtelle leads an idyllic life with his parents on their farm in remote northern Wisconsin. For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose thoughtful companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. But with the unexpected return of Claude, Edgar's paternal uncle, turmoil consumes the Sawtelles' once peaceful home. When Edgar's father dies suddenly, Claude insinuates himself into the life of the farm--and into Edgar's mother's affections. Grief-stricken and bewildered, Edgar tries to prove Claude played a role in his father's death, but his plan backfires--spectacularly. Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who follow him. But his need to face his father's murderer and his devotion to the Sawtelle dogs turn Edgar ever homeward. David Wroblewski is a master storyteller, and his breathtaking scenes--the elemental north woods, the sweep of seasons, an iconic American barn, a fateful vision rendered in the falling rain--create a riveting family saga, a brilliant exploration of the limits of language, and a compulsively readable modern classic.",

Alternative Press calls the group\'s major-label debut, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, one of the year\'s "Most Anticipated". With influences ranging from Iron Maiden and The Misfits to Morrissey, this New Jersey based band grabs listeners by the throat and then explodes with wall-of-sound energy and a cool darkness echoing Nick Cave or a young Trent Reznor. Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge - and for My Chemical Romance. Tracklisting: 1. Helena 2. Give \u2018Em Hell, Kid 3. To The End 4. You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison 5.

It is the The Chick\'s first new album since 2006\'s Taking The Long Way, which won five GRAMMY Awards including "Album of the Year," "Record of the Year," and "Song of the Year." Gaslighter is produced by Jack Antonoff with The Chicks. Superstars, renegades, innovators, heroes, villains, and moms, The Chicks have grown from a band into a cultural phenomenon. Track List: 1. Gaslighter 2. Sleep at Night 3. Texas Man 4. Everybody Loves You 5. For Her 6. March March 7. My Best Friend\'s Weddings 8. Tights on My Boat 9. Julianna Calm Down 10. Young Man 11.

Indeed, CBS chief Goddard Leiberson often stated that he took something of a chance in agreeing to release it and initial reviews were not entirely complimentary. Slowly but surely, however, Time Out picked up support, mainly from the buying public, who propelled the album to the #2 spot in the US and subsequently onto becoming the best selling Jazz album of the year. It's UK performance was a rather more modest single week at #11, but 'Take Five' reached the Top 10 when lifted as a single.",

      "It takes an extraordinary artist to re-imagine some of the most beloved songs of the 20th century and make them completely their own. And that's precisely what James Taylor has accomplished with his brand-new album, American Standard. Recalling the best of James' early work, he infuses new sounds and fresh meaning into these timeless works of art. While these 14 carefully chosen interpretations naturally feature James' warm, one-of-a-kind vocal ability and incomparable musicianship, what makes this collection so unique is the inventive way James and his fellow co-producers, longtime collaborator Dave O'Donnell and famed musician John Pizzarelli, approached the project. Unlike most who have tackled similar material, American Standard's beautifully simple, stripped-down arrangements are based on James' skillful acoustic guitar work rather than piano and the affect is mesmerizing. This edition features two EXCLUSIVE bonus tracks: 1. My Blue Heaven 2. Moon River 3. Teach Me Tonight 4. As Easy as Rolling off a Log 5. Almost Like Being in Love 6. Sit Down You\u2019re Rockin\u2019 the Boat 7. Nearness of You 8. You\u2019ve Got To Be Carefully Taught 9. God Bless The Child 10. Pennies From Heaven 11. My Heart Stood Still 12. Ol\u2019 Man River 13. (It\u2019s Only) a Paper Moon 14. The Surrey With The Fringe on Top BONUS TRACKS 15. I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face 16. Never Never Land",

      "It is 1956. Three years ago, Leo Demidov moved on from his career as a member of the state security force. As an MGB officer, Leo had been responsible for untold numbers of arrests and interrogations. But as a reward for his heroic service in stopping a killer who had terrorized citizens throughout the country, Leo was granted the authority to establish and run a homicide department in Moscow. Now, he strives to see justice done on behalf of murder victims in the Soviet capital, while at the same time working to build a life with his wife Raisa and their adopted daughters, Zoya and Elena.Leo's past, however, can not be left behind so easily, and the legacy of his former career--the friends and families of those he had arrested as a state security officer--continues to hound him. Now, a new string of murders in the capital threaten to bring Leo's past crashing into the present, shattering the fragile foundations of his new life in Moscow, and putting his daughter Zoya's life at risk.Faced with a threat to his family, Leo is launched on a desperate, personal mission that will take him to the harsh Siberian Gulags, to the depths of the hidden criminal underworld, and into the heart of Budapest and the Hungarian uprising.

Now working as a homicide detective, Leo has long since repudiated his days as an MGB officer, but his former colleagues, fearful of reprisals from their victims, have begun taking their own lives. Leo himself becomes the target of Fraera, the wife of a priest he imprisoned. Now the leader of a violent criminal gang, Fraera kidnaps Leo's daughter, Zoya, and threatens to kill Zoya if Leo doesn't liberate her husband from his gulag prison. Shifting from Moscow to Siberia and to a Hungary convulsed by revolution, this fast-paced novel is packed with too many incidents for Smith to dwell on any in great depth. Though its drama often lacks emotional resonance, this story paints a memorable portrait of post-Stalinist Russia at its dawn.",

Now working as a homicide detective, Demidov is being threatened by the wife of a Russian Orthodox priest, whom he was responsible for imprisoning in the old days. Now the priest's wife has every intention of killing Demidov's daughter if he does not get her husband released from the gulag. Dennis Boutsikaris's Russian accents are superb.

      "*Starred Review* Smith\u2019s stunning debut, Child 44 (2008), was long-listed for the 2008 Man Booker Prize. Now he\u2019s back, and so is his long-suffering, soulful, courageous hero, Leo Demidov. It\u2019s 1956, and Leo, heartsick over his dutiful work as an MGB (State Security) agent, which requires him to send innocent people to the gulag, wants only to love and support his wife, Raisa, and their two adopted daughters, Zoya and Elena. But Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s speech to the twentieth Communist Party Congress, criticizing Stalin\u2019s brutality and mandating reform, frees many former prisoners and starts a wave of brutal reprisals against Soviet bureaucrats. Leo and his family are prime targets of a driven, devious, and dangerous female gang leader, whose goal in life is to make Leo suffer more than she did. Her machinations lead Leo through the freezing sewers of Moscow to the gulag and on to Budapest, just\u00a0as\u00a0Soviet tanks are leveling it.\u00a0As in Child 44, Smith\u2019s plotting is elaborate, and his pacing is relentless. His characters are wonderfully drawn, and the near-nonstop action is utterly gripping. Again, as in the earlier book,\u00a0however, the author\u2019s greatest success is in personalizing the stunning tragedy and brutality of life for many millions of Russians. The Secret Speech is a harrowing novel, but everyone who loved Child 44 will leap to read it. --Thomas Gaughan",

      "Helen Mirren reigns supreme in",
      "The Queen",
      ", a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor: the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.",
      "None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (",
      "Dirty Pretty Things",
      ") deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.",

      "The second installment in the Grail Quest series, from one of our bestselling authors. In Harlequin, Thomas of Hookton travelled to France as an archer and there discovered a shadowy destiny, which linked him to a family of heretical French lords who sought Christendom's greatest relic: the Holy Grail. Vagabond continues the story of a search that Thomas is reluctant to pursue. He doubts the grail's existence, and he has other promises to keep, promises that take him back to Brittany where a vicious civil war is about to reach its climax. But other folk, far more powerful than Thomas and his friends, fear the rumour of the grail's existence and force Thomas to pursue the relic, while his enemies, faceless and ruthless, fear Thomas's destiny and determine to destroy him. Thomas's allies are few and weak: a hedge priest, a renegade French knight, a Jewish adventurer and a crippled English soldier -- but now they must unite and find greater strengths to pierce the mysteries of Christendom.",

      "This audiobook (unabridged and read by the author) is dedicated to your mastery of the art of realising all your desires. The greatest gift you have been given is the gift of your imagination. Everything that now exists was once imagined. And everything that will ever exist must first be imagined. Wishes Fulfilled is designed to take you on a voyage of discovery, wherein you can begin to tap into the amazing manifesting powers that you possess within you and create a life in which all that you imagine for yourself becomes a present fact. Dr Wayne W. Dyer explores, for the first time, the region of your highest self; and definitively shows you how you can truly change your concept of yourself, embark upon a God-realised way of living and fulfill the spiritual truth that with God all things are possible - and 'all things' means that nothing is left out. By practicing the specific technique for retraining your subconscious mind, you are encouraged to not only place into your imagination what you would like to manifest for yourself, but you are given the specifics for realigning your life so you can live out your highest calling and stay connected to your Source of being. From the lofty perspective of your highest self, you will learn how to train your imagination in a new way. Your wishes - all of them - can indeed be fulfilled. By using your imagination and practicing the art of assuming the feeling of your wishes being fulfilled, and steadfastly refusing to allow any evidence of the outer world to distract you from your intentions, you will discover that you, by virtue of your spiritual awareness, possess the ability to become the person you were destined to be. This audiobook will help you See - with a capital S - that you are divine, and that you already possess an inner, invisible higher self that can and will guide you toward a mastery of the art of manifestation. You can attain this mastery through deliberate conscious control of your imagination!",

People recognise him though, as an excellent impersonator. The inevitable happens, and ranting Hitler becomes a YouTube star, gets his own TV show, becoming someone who people listen to. All while he's still trying to convince people that yes, it really is him, and yes, he really means it. This recording is unabridged . Typically abridged audiobooks are not more than 60% of the author's work and as low as 30% with characters and plotlines removed.",

      "The album from the movie based on the true story of the West Country musical phenomenon The Fisherman Friends. The band of fishermen, shopkeepers, potters, and builders, that got to together 30 years ago to raise money for local charities by performing sea shanties on the beach in Port Isaac, managed to conquer the top 10 in 2010. They also performed on Glastonbury's legendary Pyramid Stage, at the prestigious Royal Albert Hall and subsequently have toured all over the UK. The film of their meteoric rise features 17 songs recorded in their local church in St Kew. Some new, some borrowed and some slightly blue. While only making cameo appearances in the film the bands unique songs and voices weave their way through the heartfelt, poignant and at times hilarious narrative, providing the bedrock for what has already been hailed as one of the film highlights of 2019. Track List: 1. Keep Hauling 2. Nelson's Blood 3. John Kanaka 4. The Coast of High Barbary 5. South Australia 6. Little liz I Love You 7. Widow Woman 8. Le Capitaine De San Malo 9. Blow the Man Down 10. Shanty Man 11. Oh You New York Girls 12. The 'Trelawny' National Anthem 13. The Leaving Shanty 14. No Hopers, Jokers & Rogues 15. Fisherman's Blues 16.

Features production from Just Blaze, Jim Jonsin and Mobb Deep's Havoc plus guest appearances from Lil Wayne, Pink and Rihanna. \"I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year,\" remarked Eminem. \"But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title.\u201d Track List: 1. Cold Wind Blows 2. Talkin' 2 Myself 3. On Fire 4. Won't Back Down 5. W.T.P.  6.

      "When the Metropolitan Police fail to realise a serial killer is at work, London ignites over the fact that the killer's victims are young black and mixed race boys. Institutionalised racism is claimed by the community's activists and tabloids alike. Acting Superintendent Thomas Lynley is given the case, and his Scotland Yard task force is soon handling more killings and a looming tragedy. Elizabeth George brings to the familiar subject of the serial killer a freshness and clarity of vision that provide illuminating insight into the psychological complexity of the tortured criminal mind. She does so within a richly textured, thrillingly suspenseful narrative that defies any reader to predict its outcome. Nor does she neglect our favourite characters, whose private lives provide an engrossing counterpoint to their professional duties.",

      "Unplugged won 1993 Grammy Awards for Album of The Year, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. It's interesting to hear Eric Clapton in an acoustic setting, because he made his mark as one of the early proponents of high-decibel rock. Stripping down the music of an artist as technically proficient and historically based as Eric Clapton was a stroke of genius. Hence, it's no surprise that the result, Unplugged, is brilliant as well. Track List: 1. Signe 2. Before You Accuse Me 3. Hey Hey 4. Tears in Heaven 5. Lonely Stranger 6. Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out 7. Layla 8. Running on Faith 9. Walkin' Blues 10. Alberta 11. San Francisco Bay Blues 12. Malted Milk 13. Old Love 14. Rollin' & Tumblin'",

      "George MacDonald Fraser's famous Flashman series appears for the first time in audio book with an exciting new series style, ready to please his legions of old fans and attract armies of new ones. The Flashman Papers 1839-1842 Volume One Flashman, soldier, duellist, lover, imposter, coward, cad and hero, triumphs in this first instalment of The Flashman Papers. His adventures as the reluctant secret agent in Afghanistan and his entry into the exclusive company of Lord Cardigan's Hussars culminate in his foulest hour -- his part in the historic disaster of the Retreat from Kabul. This is the story of a blackguard who enjoyed villainy for its own sake. Shameless, exciting and funny, Flashman's deplorable odyssey is observed with the cynical eye of a scoundrel who was honest only in reporting what he saw. He makes all other black sheep look respectable grey.",

Rather than basking in marital bliss, the newlyweds are living in separate cottages and accusing each other of infidelity. After a particularly raucous fight in the local pub, James suddenly vanishes-a bloodstain the only clue to his fate-and Agatha is the prime suspect. Determined to clear her name and find her husband, Agatha begins her investigation. But her sleuthing is thwarted when James's suspected mistress, Melissa, is found murdered. Joined by her old friend Sir Charles, Agatha digs into Melissa's past and uncovers two ex-husbands, an angry sister, and dubious relations with bikers. Are Melissa's death and James's disappearance connected? Will Agatha reunite with her husband or will she find herself alone once again?",

Now only five individuals stand between the white killer robots of Krikkit and their goal of total annihilation.They are Arthur Dent, a mild-mannered space and time traveler, who tries to learn how to fly by throwing himself at the ground and missing; Ford Prefect, his best friend, who decides to go insane to see if he likes it; Slartibartfast, the indomitable vicepresident of the Campaign for Real Time, who travels in a ship powered by irrational behavior; Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two-headed, three-armed ex-head honcho of the Universe; and Trillian, the sexy space cadet who is torn between a persistent Thunder God and a very depressed Beeblebrox.How will it all end?

      "Martin Freeman has the likable manner, precise diction, and restrained silliness that the comedic Hitchhiker books require, as well as, of course, a British accent. In this third book, reluctant space traveler Arthur Dent and associates must stop the inhabitants of the planet Krikkit from destroying the universe because they're upset at not being alone in it. Freeman provides accents--his American accents are accurate, if exaggerated--and funny voices, and his voice is also electronically altered for special effects. At times it's over-the-top goofy, and some of the voice distortions verge on lacking clarity, but generally he's as clear as the sometimes complex whimsy demands. Any fan of the books should enjoy this presentation. W.M. \u00a9 AudioFile 2006, Portland, Maine--",

      "comes a magnificent new work of fiction. Here, the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan, stalked by enemies seen and unseen and plagued by a divided family, leads a sprawling force of horsemen beyond the realm of their known world. He will bring a storm to Arab lands and face the armies of the shah in all their strength. From the fierce cold plains of Mongolia to the Korean Peninsula, Genghis\u2019s brothers, sons, and commanders have made emperors bow, slaughtering vast armies of fighting men. But as Genghis enters a strange new land of towering mountains and arid desert, he stirs an enemy greater than any he has met before. Under his command, Shah Ala-ud-Din Mohammed has thousands of fierce Arab warriors, teeming cavalry, and terrifying armored elephants. When Genghis strikes, the Arabs prove their mettle. On the verge of defeat, Genghis is forced to leave his own vast encampment, and the women and children in it, in the path of an enraged, savage enemy. While the Mongols\u2014men, women, and children\u2014fight back, as secret assassins are sent into the night, another battle is taking shape. Two of Genghis\u2019s sons, Jochi and Chagatai, are steeped in enmity. Warriors choose between them, and a murderer commits an unspeakable crime. Soon the most powerful man in the world, who has brought devastation to this land, must choose a successor. And when he does, it will touch off the most bitter conflict of all. In a novel that ranges from the fertile lands of the Chin to the dust and rock of Afghanistan, Conn Iggulden weaves the epic story of history\u2019s most enigmatic conqueror \u2014those who feared him, those who defied him, and those whose bones he left behind.",

      "Genghis Khan continues his conquest of Asia in the third installment of Iggulden\u2019s stirring epic (following Genghis: Lords of the Bow, 2008, and Genghis: Birth of an Empire, 2007).\u00a0As Genghis and his armies push into central Asia, they are challenged by the crafty and powerful Shah Mohammed. The Arabs prove to be formidable enemies, and the Mongols spend years attempting to defeat them. Meanwhile, Genghis is threatened by forces within his own camp as two of his sons vie for influence among factions of warriors. Iggulden\u2019s mastery of the battle scene is in evidence as the brutally long campaign rages on. This appropriately page-turning treatment of a sweeping historical saga will appeal to fans of gritty combat fiction. --Margaret Flanagan",

      'THE WIND HAD FALLEN on the high ridge. Dark clouds drifted above, making bands of shadow march across the earth. The morning was quiet and the land seemed empty as the two men rode at the head of a narrow column, a jagun of a hundred young warriors. The Mongols could have been alone for a thousand miles, with just creaking leather and snorting ponies to break the stillness. When they halted to listen, it was as if silence rolled back in over the dusty ground.Tsubodai was a general to the Great Khan, and it showed in the way he held himself. His armor of iron scales over leather was well worn, with holes and rust in many places. His helmet was marked where it had saved his life more than once. All his equipment was battered, but the man himself remained as hard and unforgiving as the winter earth. In three years of raiding the north, he had lost only one minor skirmish and returned the following day to destroy the tribe before word could spread. He had mastered his trade in a land that seemed to grow colder with each mile into the wastes. He had no maps for his journey, just rumors of distant cities built on rivers frozen so solid that oxen could be roasted on the ice. At his right shoulder rode Jochi, the eldest son of the khan himself. Barely seventeen, he was yet a warrior who might inherit the nation and perhaps command even Tsubodai in war. Jochi wore a similar set of greased leather and iron, as well as the saddle packs and weapons all the warriors carried. Tsubodai knew without asking that Jochi would have his ration of dried blood and milk, needing only water to make a nourishing broth. The land did not forgive those who took survival lightly, and both men had learned the lessons of winter.Jochi sensed the scrutiny and his dark eyes flickered up, always guarded. He had spent more time with the young general than he ever had with his father, but old habits were hard to break. It was difficult for him to trust, though his respect for Tsubodai knew no limit. The general of the Young Wolves had a feel for war, though he denied it. Tsubodai believed in scouts, training, tactics, and archery above all else, but the men who followed him saw only that he won, no matter what the odds. As others could fashion a sword or a saddle, Tsubodai fashioned armies, and Jochi knew he was privileged to learn at his side. He wondered if his brother Chagatai had fared as well in the east. It was easy to daydream as he rode the hills, imagining his brothers and father struck dumb at the sight of how Jochi had grown and become strong. "What is the most important item in your packs?" Tsubodai said suddenly.Jochi raised his eyes to the brooding sky for an instant. Tsubodai delighted in testing him."Meat, General. Without meat, I cannot fight.""Not your bow?" Tsubodai said. "Without a bow, what are you?""Nothing, General, but without meat, I am too weak to use the bow."Tsubodai grunted at hearing his own words repeated. "When the meat is all gone, how long can you live off blood and milk?""Sixteen days at most, with three remounts to share the wounds."\u00a0 Jochi did not have to think. He had been drilled in the answers ever since he and Tsubodai had ridden with ten thousand men from the shadow of the Chin emperor\'s city."How far could you travel in such a time?" Tsubodai said.Jochi shrugged.\u00a0 "Sixteen hundred miles with fresh remounts. Half again as far if I slept and ate in the saddle." Tsubodai saw that the young man was hardly concentrating, and his eyes glinted as he changed tack. "What is wrong with the ridge ahead?" he snapped.Jochi raised his head, startled. "I . . .""Quickly! Men are looking to you for a decision. Lives wait on your word."Jochi swallowed, but in Tsubodai he had learned from a master."The sun is behind us, so we will be visible for miles as we reach the crest." Tsubodai began to nod, but Jochi went on. "The ground is dusty. If we cross the high point of the ridge at any speed, we will raise a cloud into the air.""That is good, Jochi," Tsubodai said. As he spoke, he dug in his heels and rode hard at the crest ahead. As Jochi had predicted, the hundred riders released a mist of reddish grit that billowed above their heads. Someone would surely see and report their position.Tsubodai did not pause as he reached the ridge. Digging in his heels, he sent his mare over, the rear legs skittering on loose stones. Jochi matched him and then took a sharp breath of dust that made him cough into his hand. Tsubodai had come to a halt fifty paces beyond the ridge, where the broken ground began to dip to the valley. Without orders, his men formed a wide double rank around him, like a bow drawn on the ground. They were long familiar with the firebrand of a general who had been placed over them. Tsubodai stared into the distance, frowning. The surrounding hills enclosed a flat plain through which a river ran, swollen with spring rain. Along its banks, a slow-moving column trotted, bright with flags and banners. In other circumstances, it would have been a sight to take the breath, and even as his stomach clenched, Jochi felt a touch of admiration. Ten, perhaps eleven thousand Russian knights rode together, house colors in gold and red streaming back over their heads. Almost as many followed them in a baggage train of carts and remounts, women, boys, and servants. The sun chose that moment to break through the dark clouds in a great beam that lit the valley. The knights shone.Their horses were massive, shaggy animals, almost twice the weight of the Mongol ponies. Even the men who rode them were a strange breed to Jochi\'s eyes. They sat like they were made of stone, solid and heavy in metal cloth from their cheeks to their knees. Only their blue eyes and hands were unprotected. The armored knights had come prepared for battle, carrying long spears like lances, but tipped in steel. They rode with the weapons upright, the butts held in leather cups close behind the stirrups. Jochi could see axes and swords hanging down from waist belts, and every man rode with a leaf-shaped shield hooked to his saddle. The pennants streamed back over their heads and they looked very fine in the bands of gold and shadow. "They must see us," Jochi murmured, glancing at the plume of dust above his head.The general heard him speak and turned in the saddle. "They are not men of the plains, Jochi. They are half blind over such a distance. Are you afraid? They are so large, these knights. I would be afraid."For an instant, Jochi glowered. From his father, it would have been mockery. Yet Tsubodai spoke with a light in his eyes. The general was still in his twenties, young to command so many. Tsubodai was not afraid, though. Jochi knew the general cared nothing for the massive warhorses or the men who rode them. Instead, he placed his faith in the speed and arrows of his Young Wolves.The jagun was made up of ten arbans, each commanded by an officer. By Tsubodai\'s order, only those ten men wore heavy armor. The rest had only leather tunics under padded deels. Jochi knew Genghis preferred the heavy charge to the light, but Tsubodai\'s men seemed to survive. They could hit and gallop faster than the ponderous Russian warriors, and there was no fear in their ranks. Like Tsubodai, they looked hungrily down the slope at the column and waited to be seen."You know your father sent a rider to bring me home?" Tsubodai said.Jochi nodded. "All the men know.""I had hoped to go further north than this, but I am your father\'s man. He speaks and I obey, do you understand?"Jochi stared at the young general, forgetting for a moment the knights who rode in the valley below."Of course," he said, his face showing nothing.Tsubodai glanced back at him, amused. "I hope you do, Jochi. He is a man to follow, your father. I wonder how he will respond when he sees how well you have grown."For a moment, anger twisted Jochi\'s face before he smoothed his features and took a deep breath. Tsubodai had been more like a father than his own in many ways, but he did not forget the man\'s true loyalty. At an order from Genghis, Tsubodai would kill him. As he looked at the young general, he thought there would be some regret, but not enough to hold the blow."He will need loyal men, Tsubodai," Jochi said. "My father would not call us back to build or rest. He will have found some new land to tear to pieces. Like the wolf, he is always hungry, even to the point of bursting his own stomach."Tsubodai frowned to hear the khan described in such a way. In three years, he had seen no affection when Jochi spoke of his father, though sometimes there was a wistfulness that showed less and less as the seasons passed. Genghis had sent away a boy, but a man would return to him, Tsubodai had made certain of that. For all his bitterness, Jochi was a cool head in battle and the men looked on him with pride. He would do."I have another question for you, Jochi," Tsubodai said.Jochi smiled for an instant. "You always have, General," he replied. "We have drawn these iron knights after us for hundreds of miles, exhausting their horses. We have captured their scouts and put them to the question, though I do not know of this \'Jerusalem\' they seek, or who this \'white Christ\' is." Tsubodai shrugged. "Perhaps I will meet him one day over the length of my sword, but the world is large and I am but one man." As he spoke, he watched the armored knights and the trailing baggage lines behind them, waiting to be seen."My question, Jochi, is this. These knights are nothing to me. Your father has called me back and I could ride now, while the ponies are fat with summer grass. Why then are we here, waiting for the challenge?"Jochi\'s eyes were cold as he replied."My father would say it is what we do, that there is no better way for a man to spend his years than at war with enemies. He might also say you enjoy it, General, and that is all the reason you need."Tsubodai\'s gaze did not waver. "Perhaps he would say that, but you hide behind his words. Why are we here, Jochi? We do not want their big horses, even for meat. Why will I risk the lives of warriors to smash the column you see?"Jochi shrugged irritably. "If it is not that, I do not know.""For you, Jochi," Tsubodai said seriously. "When you return to your father, you will have seen all forms of battle, in all seasons. You and I have captured towns and raided cities, ridden desert and forests so thick we could hardly cut our way through. Genghis will find no weakness in you." Tsubodai smiled briefly at Jochi\'s stony expression. "I will be proud when men say you learned your skill under Tsubodai the Valiant."Jochi had to grin at hearing the nickname from Tsubodai himself. There were no secrets in the camps."There it is," Tsubodai muttered, pointing to a distant messenger racing to the head of the Russian column. "We have an enemy who leads from the front, a very brave man."Jochi could imagine the sudden dismay among the knights as they looked into the bowl of hills and saw the Mongol warriors. Tsubodai grunted softly as an entire rank peeled off the column and began trotting up the slopes, the long spears ready. He showed his teeth as the gap began to narrow. They were charging uphill, in their arrogance. He longed to teach them their error."Do you have your paitze, Jochi? Show it to me."Jochi reached behind him to where his bow holder was strapped to the saddle. He lifted a flap in the stiff leather and pulled out a plaque of solid gold, stamped with a wolf\'s head in profile. At twenty ounces, it was heavy, but small enough for him to grip in his hand.Tsubodai ignored the men rising doggedly up the hill to face the eldest son of Genghis."You have that and the right to command a thousand by my hand, Jochi. Those who command a jagun have one of mere silver, like this." Tsubodai held up a larger block of the whitish metal. "The difference is that the silver paitze is given to a man elected by the officers of each arban below him.""I know this," Jochi said.Tsubodai glanced back at the knights laboring closer. "The officers of this jagun have asked to have you lead them, Jochi. I had no part in it." He held out the silver paitze and Jochi took it joyfully, passing back the plaque of gold.Tsubodai was solemn and deliberately formal, but his eyes were bright. "When you return to your father, Jochi, you will have known all ranks and positions." The general gestured, cutting the air with his hand. "On the right, the left, and the center." He looked over the heads of the straining knights cantering up the hill, seeing a flicker of movement on a crag in the distance. Tsubodai nodded sharply."It is time. You know what you have to do, Jochi. Command is yours." Without another word, Tsubodai clapped the younger man on the shoulder and rode back over the ridge, leaving the jagun of riders in the care of one suddenly nervous leader.Jochi could feel the combined stares of the hundred men on his back as he struggled to hide his pleasure. Each arban of ten elected one man to lead them, then those men elected one of their number to lead the hundred in war. To be so chosen was an honor. A voice in his mind whispered that they only honored his father, but he crushed it, refusing to doubt. He had earned the right and confidence swelled in him."Bow lines!" Jochi called. He gripped his reins tightly to hide his tension as the men formed a wider line so that every bow could bear. Jochi glanced over his shoulder, but Tsubodai had truly gone, leaving him alone. The men still watched and he forced the cold face, knowing they would remember his calm. As they raised their bows, he held up a clenched fist, waiting while his heart thumped painfully in his chest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At four hundred paces, Jochi dropped his arm and the first flight of arrows whipped into the air. It was too far and those that reached the knights splintered on their shields, now held high and forward, so that almost the entire man was protected. The long shields showed their purpose as a second flight struck the ranks without a single rider going down.The powerful horses were not fast, but still the gap closed and Jochi only watched. At two hundred paces, he raised his fist once more and another hundred arrows waited on creaking strings. At such a distance, he did not know if the knights\' armor would save them. Nothing ever had. "Shoot like you have never owned a bow," he shouted. The men around him grinned and the arrows snapped out. Jochi winced instinctively at shafts that went clear over the enemy heads, as if loosed by panicking fools. Only a few struck, and of those, still fewer brought a horse or man down. They could hear the thunder of the charge now and saw the front ranks begin to lower their spears in anticipation.Facing them, Jochi smothered his fear in a sudden bloom of rage. He wanted nothing more than to draw his sword and kick his mount down the slope at the enemy. Shaking with frustration, he gave a different order."Retreat over the ridge," Jochi shouted. He wrenched at his reins and his horse jerked into a run. His jagun shouted incoherently, turning in chaos after their general. Behind him, he heard guttural voices yelling in triumph and acid rose in his throat, though whether it was from fear or anger, he did not know.',

      "Starred Review. The exciting third novel in Iggulden's Genghis Khan series tells the dramatic story of the Mongol invasion and conquest of Central Asia. Genghis has already defeated the Chinese and Koreans, and now marches his vast army west to punish and conquer the Muslim lands of central Asia ruled by Shah Mohammed. For eight years the Mongols ravage the shah's empire, crushing armies, destroying cities and slaughtering anyone who resists. Iggulden's vivid descriptions of bloody battles, masterful sieges and political intrigue are gripping, showcasing Genghis's brilliance as a strategist, tactician, administrator and leader. Side plots include the deadly rivalry between two of Genghis's sons, the rape and murder of Genghis's sister by a trusted adviser, the surprising rise of the shah's son as a capable enemy and the treachery of Genghis's son toward his father. This is epic historical fiction at its finest: exciting, suspenseful, colorful and well-grounded in fact. With this tale, it is easy to see why the name Genghis is synonymous with conquest and military genius.",

      "Muse didn't set out to make the most gloriously ambitious album of their career. How could they have? The band who dreamt up \"Supermassive Black Hole,\" Knights Of Cydonia and the three-part \"Exogenesis\" symphony were already well-versed in going One Louder. Any wilder, any further out there, and Muse would risk incineration by a dwarf star of their own making. But you don't become one of the biggest bands on this planet by sitting on your hands. So when Muse approached the making of their sixth studio album, they wouldn't stint on the choirs, strings and horn sections. And be reassured: guitar-shredding, piano-thumping, orchestra-arranging, book-chewing, big-thinking Matt Bellamy, as the band's chief songwriter, didn't lower his sights from The Big Picture nor ignore The Precious Details. And nor were the trio afraid of giving space to a brilliant new element to their sound - songs written and sung by bass player Chris Wolstenholme.  Track List: 1. Supremacy 2. Madness 3. Panic Station 4. Prelude 5. Survival 6. Follow Me 7. Animals 8. Explorers 9. Big Freeze 10. Save Me 11. Liquid State 12. The 2nd Law: Unsustainable 13. The 2nd Law: Isolated System",

      "On a cold February afternoon, Stella catches sight of a man she hasn't seen for many years, but she instantly recognises him. Or thinks she does. At the same moment on the other side of the globe, in the middle of a crowd of Chinese New Year revellers, Jake realises that things are becoming dangerous. They know nothing of one another's existence, but both Stella and Jake flee their lives: Jake in search of a place so remote it doesn't appear on any map, and Stella for a destination in Scotland, the significance of which only her sister, Nina, will understand. Gripping, insightful and deft, this is Maggie O'Farrell's finest achievement to date.",

      'Some Girls introduced a whole new generation to the music of the Stones. The infectious dance groove of "Miss You" topped the US charts, as did the album in 1978. Both releases also made the Top 3 in the UK, where the country flavored "Far Away Eyes,\u201d featuring Ronnie Wood on pedal steel guitar, enjoyed substantial airplay. "Respectable,\u201d the follow-up single in Britain, proved that they could match the punks they had influenced so much. Track List: 1. Miss You 2. When the Whip Comes Down 3. Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)  4. Some Girls 5. Lies 6. Far Away Eyes 7. Respectable 8. Before They Make Me Run 9. Beast of Burden 10. Shattered',

      "Mrs. McGinty died from a brutal blow to the back of her head. Suspicion falls immediately on her shifty lodger, James Bentley, whose clothes reveal traces of the victim\u2019s blood and hair. Yet something is amiss: Bentley just doesn\u2019t seem like a murderer.",

      "About the Author",
      "Agatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890 and became, quite simply, the best-selling novelist in history. Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of the First World War, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in over 100 foreign languages. She is the author of 80 crime novels and short story collections, 19 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.",

      "INCLUDES A BONUS MP3 CD OF JEFFERY DEAVER'S THE BLUE NOWHERE! The latest Kathryn Dance thriller from the New York Times bestselling author of The Sleeping Doll! The Monterey Peninsula is rocked when a killer begins to leave roadside crosses beside local highways -- not in memoriam, but as announcements of his intention to kill. And to kill in particularly horrific and efficient ways: using the personal details about the victims that they've carelessly posted in blogs and on social networking websites. The case lands on the desk of Kathryn Dance, the California Bureau of Investigations foremost body language expert. She and Deputy Michael O'Neil follow the leads to Travis Brigham, a troubled teenager whose role in a fatal car accident has inspired vicious attacks against him on a popular blog, The Chilton Report. As the investigation progresses, Travis vanishes. Using techniques he learned as a brilliant participant in multiplayer online role-playing games, he easily eludes his pursuers and continues to track his victims. Among the obstacles Kathryn must hurdle are politicians from Sacramento, paranoid parents and the blogger himself, James Chilton, whose belief in the importance of blogging and the new media threatens to derail the case and potentially Dance's career. It is this threat that causes Dance to take desperate and risky measures... In signature Jeffery Deaver style, Roadside Crosses is filled with dozens of plot twists, cliff-hangers and heartrending personal subplots. It is also a searing look at the accountability of blogging and life in the online world. Roadside Crosses is the third in Deaver's bestselling High-Tech Thriller Trilogy, along with The Blue Nowhere and The Broken Window.",

    description: [
      'Cat Stevens tends to be lumped in with the early-1970s singer/songwriter school led by James Taylor and Carole King but he actually fits in rather neatly with such wistful contemporaries as Nick Drake, Syd Barrett and Donovan. Tea for the Tillerman\'s "Wild World", "Into White" and "Longer Boats" indicate that he may have been a more gifted tunesmith than the lot of them. As with the best of the Brit folk-rockers, Stevens mixed melancholy with whimsy. Yes, he was prone to airy platitudes but when he harnessed his eccentricities, as he did throughout this 1970\'s masterwork, you had something truly distinctive.  Tracklist:  1. Where Do the Children Play?  2. Hard Headed Woman  3. Wild World  4. Sad Lisa  5. Miles from Nowhere  6. But I Might Die Tonight  7. Longer Boats  8. Into White  9. On the Road to Find Out  10. Father and Son  11. Tea for The Tillerman',

    description: [
      "One of the most enduring musical partnerships of our time, Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Crosby, Stills & Nash are revered for their peerless vocal harmonies, inspired songwriting and musical virtuosity. When the trio first sang together at a friend's Laurel Canyon house in 1968, their uncanny harmonic convergence was immediately apparent, and CSN took shape. Each member came to the new venture from other high-profile bands-Crosby from the Byrds, Stills from Buffalo Springfield, and Nash from the Hollies-and together, they formed that rarest of musical entities, a \"supergroup\" that lived up to its billing. CSN's 1969 self-titled debut album is one of the true masterpieces of the rock 'n' roll canon, and 1982's Daylight Again is a brilliant portrait of their musical evolution. Still touring and recording together, CSN is an American treasure.  Tracklist:  1. Suite: Judy Blue Eyes  2. Marrakesh Express  3. Guinnevere  4. You Don't Have to Cry  5. Pre-Road Downs  6. Wooden Ships  7. Lady of The Island  8. Helplessly Hoping  9. Long Time Gone   Bonus tracks:  10. 49 Bye-Byes  11. Do for The Others  12. Song with No Words  13. Everybody's Talkin'  14. Teach Your Children",

      "2013 album from the Nashville-based singer/songwriter. On Same Trailer Different Park, it's clear that this is a girl who has something to say. A true language artist, Kacey nimbly spins webs of words to create the quirky puns, shrewd metaphors, and steely ironies that fill the record. The lead single 'Merry Go Round', garnered quick airplay and critical acclaim from the likes of Rolling Stone, NPR, and Slate, where the headline above a rave review of Kacey s work read Is This the Future of Country Music? Billboard took a different track, looking to the past to qualify its praise: Had Loretta Lynn or Dolly Parton arrived on the scene in 2012 instead of the 1960s, some of their compositions could very well have ended up sounding like this. Track List: 1. Silver Lining 2. My House 3. Merry Go \u2018Round 4. Dandelion 5. Blowin\u2019 Smoke 6. I Miss You 7. Step Off 8. Back on The Map 9. Keep It to Yourself 10. Stupid 11.

      "Were you a sherbet lemon or chocolate lime fan? Penny chews or hard boiled sweeties (you do get more for your money that way)? The jangle of your pocket money...the rustle of the pink and green striped paper bag... Rosie Hopkins thinks leaving her busy London life, and her boyfriend Gerard, to sort out her elderly Aunt Lilian's sweetshop in a small country village is going to be dull. Boy, is she wrong. Lilian Hopkins has spent her life running Lipton's sweetshop, through wartime and family feuds. As she struggles with the idea that it might finally be time to settle up, she also wrestles with the secret history hidden behind the jars of beautifully coloured sweets. Read by Jane Collingwood. A sweet and nostalgic listen for fans of the novel. Running time approximately: 13 hours 1 MP3 CD unabridged",

      "Product Description",
      "For Kim Woodburn finding fame in her 60s in the smash hit television series How Clean is Your House? \"with fellow dust-buster Aggie Mackenzie is like living a fairytale. Often she has simply wished that she had never been born, for Kim has overcome horrific emotional and physical abuse both at the hands of her alcoholic mother and her philandering, sexually abusive father. In her brave and revealing story Kim's memories of growing up are not of love and cuddles, but of beatings and random cruelty. Shuttled between the brutal houses of her warring parents, a succession of miserable children's homes and a grim convent -- Kim's past has cast a long shadow over her life. But just before her sixteenth birthday she finally made her escape, only to find herself in an abusive marriage a few years later. It has taken decades of hard work, and a wonderfully happy marriage to conquer depression but now she has emerged unbowed and unbeaten as Britain's Queen of Clean.",

      'Walls finds Barbra exploring both her concerns and hopes for the future in a collection filled with beautiful melodies and thought-provoking lyrics. In addition to the three original tunes which the Oscar-winning songwriter contributed to, the songs on Walls explore topics near to the celebrated artist\'s heart. Streisand also brings a fresh perspective to the classic songs "Imagine" and "What A Wonderful World," and the Bacharach/David pop standard "What the World Needs Now." The penultimate song that Streisand sings is a timely one called "Take Care of This House" by the legendary composer Leonard Bernstein and lyricist Alan Jay Lerner. Tracklisting: 1. What\'s on My Mind 2. Don\'t Lie to Me 3. Imagine / What a Wonderful World 4. Walls 5. Lady Liberty 6. What the World Needs Now 7. Better Angels 8. Love\'s Never Wrong 9. The Rain Will Fall 10.

      "Thursday Next, literary detective and newlywed, is back to embark on an adventure that begins, quite literally on her own doorstep. It seems that Landen, her husband of four weeks, actually drowned in an accident when he was two years old. Someone, somewhere, sometime, is responsible. The sinister Goliath Corporation wants its operative Jack Schitt out of the poem in which Thursday trapped him, and it will do almost anything to achieve this - but bribing the ChronoGuard? Is that possible? Having barely caught her breath after The Eyre Affair, Thursday must battle corrupt politicians, try to save the world from extinction, and help the Neanderthals to species self-determination. Mastadon migrations, journeys into Just William, a chance meeting with the Flopsy Bunnies, and violent life-and-death struggles in the summer sales are all part of a greater plan. But whose? and why?",

      "Good Night, and Good Luck",
      "illuminates history to enlighten our present, when the need for a free and independent press is more important than ever. In 90 breathtaking minutes of efficient and intricate storytelling, writer-director George Clooney and cowriter Grant Heslov pay honorable tribute to the journalistic integrity of legendary CBS newscaster Edward R. Murrow,  Director George Clooney who confronted the virulent and overzealous anti-Communist witch-hunting of Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1953-54, and emerged as a triumphant truth-seeker against the abuses of corporate and governmental power.  David Strathairn as Edward R. Murrow As played by David Strathairn, Murrow is a dogged realist, keenly aware of the smear tactics that will be employed against him; Clooney provides crucial backup as Murrow's \"See It Now\" producer and closest confidante Fred Friendly, forming a fierce but not entirely fearless triumvirate of broadcasting bravery with CBS chief William Paley (Frank Langella), who anxiously champions Murrow's cause under constant threat of reprisals. While using crisp black-and-white cinematography (by Robert Elswit) to vividly recreate the electrifying atmosphere of the CBS newsroom and the early years of television, Clooney (son of long-time Cincinnati newsman Nick Clooney) proves his directorial skill by juggling big themes and an esteemed ensemble cast, never stooping to simplification of ethically complex material.",

Despite his quiet ways and quirky behaviors, Holden is very happy and socially normal---on the inside, in a private world all his own. In reality, he is bullied at school by kids who only see that he is very different. Ella Reynolds is part of the 'in' crowd. A cheerleader and star of the high school drama production, her life seems perfect. When she catches Holden listening to her rehearse for the school play, she is drawn to him ... the way he is drawn to the music. Then, Ella makes a dramatic discovery---she and Holden were best friends as children. Frustrated by the way Holden is bullied, and horrified at the indifference of her peers, Ella decides to take a stand against the most privileged and popular kids at school.

      "From Publishers Weekly",
      "An average of 1 in 110 children has autism spectrum disorder, an astonishing number that also bespeaks sadness and frustration on the part of lots of parents of autistic children. Popular and prolific novelist Kingsbury (Ever After) takes on autism in the story Holden Harris, an 18-year-old high school student with autism and target for high school bullies. Popular Ella Reynolds, star of the high school's musical Beauty and the Beast, sticks up for Holden against her friends who are his tormentors. Added to the complex topics of autism and bullying is a subplot about teen-age suicide, making for far more weight than this story can bear. Her legions of fans may well find this nicey-nicey story resolution inspirational; that is the Kingsbury brand. But given the gravity of the subjects, what one finds inspirational another will likely see a na\u00efve and unpersuasive fantasy that Walt Disney does a whole lot better, with music. Kingsbury is in over her head. (Oct.) (c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC. All rights reserved.",

For decade after decade, Neil's songs have been such a major part of our lives. Making this record with him has served as a profound reminder of what a powerful and amazing artist he truly is, he continued.  Track List: 1. Melody Road 2. First Time 3. Seongha and Jimmy 4.

      "MCA Nashville recording artist Sam Hunt is soaring up the country charts with his lead single, Leave the Night On the lead track off his Oct. 27 major label album debut, MONTEVALLO, a ten-track album, all co-written by Hunt, and produced by Zach Crowell (Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban) and Shane McAnally (Luke Bryan, Kacey Musgraves). This is such a personal album for me, explains Hunt. Each song holds truth and comes from my own life experiences. To get these songs out into the hands of the fans is both exciting and liberating. While completing MONTEVALLO, Hunt has continued to gain momentum on the road and grow his fanbase. As a result of their enthusiasm, last month Hunt offered fans X2C, a four-song album preview including hit song Leave the Night On. The album teaser fueled the excitement surrounding Hunt and his upcoming project. For a VERY limited time only and offered exclusively by Amazon, get this limited-edition autographed version!",

      "Harvest Moon is the twentieth studio album by Canadian musician Neil Young, released on October 27, 1992. Many of the musicians appearing on it also appeared on his 1972 album Harvest, and it is considered by many to be like a \"sequel\" to Harvest. Recovering from a case of tinnitus that had come about after the recording of 1990's Ragged Glory and its subsequent tour (which produced 1991's Weld and Arc), Young was determined to return to the studio. Returning to Nashville and joining up with compatriots like Ben Keith, Young put down the electric guitar, returning to the acoustic guitar, piano and banjo that had dominated albums such as Harvest, Comes a Time and Old Ways. Track List: 1. Unknown Legend 2. From Hank to Hendrix 3. You and Me 4. Harvest Moon 5. War of Man 6. One of These Days 7. Such a Woman 8. Old King 9. Dreamin' Man 10. Natural Beauty",

      "CD collection of the legendary band's greatest hits. Formed in NYC in the mid-'70s by David Byrne, Chris Franz, Tina Weymouth, and ex-Modern Lover Jerry Harrison, the Talking Heads evolved out of their now-legendary humble beginnings at CBGB's to become one of the most adventurous and influential bands ever. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, the Heads' visionary, polyrhythmic sound daringly combined funk and punk, African beats, avant-garde minimalism, and pure pop. From their 1977 debut through their Brian Eno-produced classics to their '88 farewell, Naked, they both pushed artistic boundaries and delivered indelible radio hits like \"Once In A Lifetime\" and \"Burning Down The House.\" Tracklist:  1. Love \u2192 Building on Fire  2. Psycho Killer  3. Uh-Oh, Love Comes to Town  4. Take Me to The River  5. Found A Job  6. Life During Wartime 7. Heaven 8. Memories Can\u2019t Wait 9. Once in A Lifetime 10. Houses in Motion 11. This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)  12. Girlfriend Is Better 13. Burning Down the House 14. Road to Nowhere 15. And She Was 16. Wild Wild Life 17. Blind 18. (Nothing But) Flowers",

      "\"Your stuff is so hard, they're gonna think it's rock 'n' roll,\" a friend once told Dwight Yoakam. Twisting strains of Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Merle Haggard, and Gram Parsons into a stripped-down sound wholly his own, Yoakam is one of music's true mavericks, and his body of work is one of the most innovative in all of country. Rooted in the purest country traditions, and wrapped in raw rock 'n' roll attitude, Yoakam's art rivets fans of both genres and remains as utterly original today as when it started burning up the charts in the '80s. Track List: 1. Honky Tonk Man 2. Guitars, Cadillacs 3. Little Sister 4. Little Ways 5. Please, Please Baby 6. Streets of Bakersfield (with Buck Owens)  7. I Sang Dixie 8. Long White Cadillac 9. Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Loose 10. You're the One 11. Suspicious Minds 12. It Only Hurts When I Cry 13. Ain't That Lonely Yet 14. A Thousand Miles from Nowhere 15. Fast as You 16. Crazy Little Thing Called Love 17. I Want You to Want Me 18. Things Change 19. The Late Great Golden State 20. The Back of Your Hand",

      '47 years after its release, Morrison\'s label debut album has achieved a near-mythic status across generations of listeners who have "ventured in the slipstream" and fallen under the music\'s spell. "Any best-of list is unthinkable - and worthless - without it," writes Cory Frye in the album\'s liner notes. Bonus tracks include the first take of "Beside You," the full version of "Slim Slow Slider," and a stripped back version of "Madame George" that emphasizes the vibraphone.  Tracklist:  1. Astral Weeks (2015 Remaster)  2. Beside You (2015 Remaster)  3. Sweet Thing (2015 Remaster)  4. Cyprus Avenue (2015 Remaster)  5. The Way Young Lovers Do (2015 Remaster)  6.

      "Jeff Beck found a kindred spirit in Johnny Depp when the two met in 2016. They bonded quickly over cars and guitars and spent most of their time together trying to make each other laugh. At the same time, Beck\u2019s appreciation grew for Depp\u2019s serious songwriting skills and his ear for music. That talent and their chemistry convinced Beck they should make an album together. Depp agreed and they started in 2019. Over the next three years, they recorded a mix of Depp originals along with a wide range of covers that touches on everything from Celtic and Motown, to the Beach. The cover features an illustration of Beck and Depp as 18-year-olds that was drawn and designed by Beck\u2019s wife Sandra.  Track List: 1. Midnight Walker 2. The Death and Resurrection Show 3. Time 4. Sad Motherfuckin' Parade 5. Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)  6. This Is a Song for Miss Hedy Lamarr 7. Caroline, No 8. Ooo Baby Baby 9. What's Going On 10. Venus in Furs 11.

      "The next generation stands on the brink of a \u201crebelution\u201d With over 10 million hits to their website , Alex and Brett Harris are leading the charge in a growing movement of Christian young people who are rebelling against the low expectations of their culture by choosing to \u201cdo hard things\u201d for the glory of God. Written when they were 18 years old, Do Hard Things is the Harris twins\u2019 revolutionary message in its purest and most compelling form, giving readers a tangible glimpse of what is possible for teens who actively resist cultural lies that limit their potential. Combating the idea of adolescence as a vacation from responsibility, the authors weave together biblical insights, history, and modern examples to redefine the teen years as the launching pad of life and map a clear trajectory for long-term fulfillment and eternal impact. Written by teens for teens, Do Hard Things is packed with humorous personal anecdotes, practical examples, and stories of real-life rebelutionaries in action. This rallying cry from the heart of revolution already in progress challenges the next generation to lay claim to a brighter future, starting today.",

      'Amaryllis, with unflinchingly honest, unrepentant songs like first single "Bully" and "I\'m Not All Right," as well as the deeply moving "Miracle" and the soulful love song "I\'ll Follow You," delivers on its mission statement throughout its 12 tracks. From a thematic standpoint, Amaryllis is a record about vulnerability. It reveals the bruises and scars, but also their healing. "It\'s not a record for the faint of heart," Smith admits. "Every single song makes a statement. I was looking for the kind of emotion that made every hair on the back of my neck stand on end. Because of that, I feel in my heart and soul that this album is a game changer for our band." Track List: 1. Adrenaline 2. Bully 3. Amaryllis 4. Unity 5. Enemies 6. I\'m Not Alright 7. Nowhere Kids 8. Miracle 9. I\'ll Follow You 10. For My Sake 11. My Name (Wearing Me Out)  12. Through the Ghost',

      "CD edition of the  new novel by the bestselling author of Innocent Traitor . .Alison Weir was already one of Britain's most popular historians when she wrote her first novel, Innocent Traitor , which hit the Sunday Times bestseller list to a chorus of praise.Now, in her second novel, Alison Weir goes to the heart of Tudor England at its most dangerous and faction-riven in telling the story of Elizabeth I before she became queen. The towering capricious figure of Henry VIII dominates her childhood, but others play powerful roles: Mary, first a loving sister, then as queen a lethal threat; Edward, the rigid and sad little King; Thomas Seymour, the Lord High Admiral, whose ambitions, both political and sexual, are unbridled. And, an ever-present ghost, the enigmatic, seductive figure of her mother Anne Boleyn, executed by Henry, whose story Elizabeth must unravel. Elizabeth learns early that the adult world contains many threats that have to be negotiated if she is to keep her heart and her head.",

      "The 19-track collection spans 1974 and 1982 and features many of group\u2019s best-loved songs, like Can\u2019t Get Enough, Feel Like Makin Love and Rock N Roll Fantasy.  Longtime fans will certainly appreciate the inclusion of previously unreleased alternate versions of Easy on My Soul and See the Sunlight. Both are different versions than the ones that appeared on the deluxe editions Bad Company and Straight Shooter.  Singer songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Paul Rodgers along with guitarist/songwriter Mick Ralphs, bassist Boz Burrell and drummer Simon Kirke recorded Bad Company s eponymous debut in 1973. When it was released in 1974, the album was an instant smash and climbed to the top of the album charts. Since then, it has been certified five-times platinum. It features such instantly recognizable tracks as Movin\u2019 On and Ready for Love, which are included on this new collection.  Tracklist:  1. Can't Get Enough  2. Bad Company  3. Movin' On  4. Ready for Love  5. Easy on My Soul  6. Good Lovin' Gone Bad  7. Feel like Makin' Love  8. Shooting Star  9. Weep No More  10. See the Sunlight  11. Live for the Music  12. Simple Man  13. Honey Child  14. Run with the Pack  15. Burnin' Sky  16. Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy  17. Rhythm Machine  18. Gone, Gone, Gone  19. Electricland",

      "The much anticipated double CD of John Mayer in concert includes all the guitar player\u0092s hits, and the sound is unique. But the album is nothing more than a compilation of the different facets of Mayer, whose performance is divided into his three major stages. In the first part, he sings with the sole accompaniment of his acoustic guitar. Then he moves to a more jazz- and blues-inclined trio format (guitar, bass, and drums). Finally, Mayer joins his entire band with a rock sound. The truth is that the musician did not make the least effort to come up with new arrangements for his songs. If you have Mayer\u0092s previous live CDs, there\u0092s is not a single note here that you haven\u0092t heard before.",

Pero tambi\u00e9n hay que decir que el disco nos es m\u00e1s que una compilaci\u00f3n de las diferentes facetas de Mayer que dividi\u00f3 su actuaci\u00f3n en tres etapas: la primera parte del concierto es \u00e9l acompa\u00f1ado por su guitarra ac\u00fastica, posteriormente viene una etapa con tr\u00edo (guitarra, bajo y bater\u00eda) que se inclina m\u00e1s hac\u00eda el Jazz y Blues, y finalmente podemos disfrutar de Mayer acompa\u00f1ado de toda su banda y con sonido rockero. La realidad es que el m\u00fasico no hizo ning\u00fan esfuerzo por crear nuevo arreglos para sus canciones, si usted tiene los discos anteriores del cantautor en vivo, no tiene por qu\u00e9 comprar este, no hay una sola nota que no haya escuchado antes.

      "Their affair is the scandal of Europe... Queen Elizabeth cannot resist her dashing but married Master of Horse, Lord Robert Dudley. Many believe them to be lovers. The formidable young Queen is regarded by most as a bastard and a heretic, yet many seek her hand in marriage. Desperately insecure, Elizabeth embarks on a perilous balancing act, using sex and high-powered diplomacy to play what becomes known as 'the Marriage Game'. This recording is unabridged. Typically abridged audiobooks are not more than 60% of the author's work and as low as 30% with characters and plotlines removed.",

      "With an intoxicating, genre-blending sound, provocative and uncompromising songs and the mesmerizing power of singer Jim Morrison\u2019s poetry and presence, The Doors had a transformative impact not only on popular music but on popular culture.  Their debut album The Doors in 1967 showcased the band\u2019s controversial form of dark, brooding rock, an antithesis to the popular Californian sunshine pop of the 1960s. Followed by Strange Days, Waiting for the Sun, The Soft Parade, Morrison Hotel and L.A. Woman The Doors continued to make iconic albums which would maintain their influence on popular music to this day. Tragically The Doors run was cut short with the death of Jim Morrison in 1971, 40 years ago this year (3rd July).  This collection packages the complete anthology of The Doors studio albums with Jim Morrison. It features the 40th anniversary versions of the tracks, remastered by The Doors and Bruce Botnik, with the original artwork in replicated paper sleeves.  Click on the product image above to see the complete track listing.",

      "From Queen of Tarts to the nation's heart, Mary Berry shares her Recipe for Life . Read by the actress Patricia Hodge. 'In the words of my father, my birth caused no end of trouble...' From the moment she came into the world - two weeks early, throwing her parents' lives into disarray - Mary has gracefully but firmly done things her own way. Born in 1935, in the city of Bath, Mary's childhood was a curious mix of idyllic picnics and ramblings, and alarming air raids; of a spirited and outdoorsy home life and a dreaded school existence. All nearly cut horribly short by an almost fatal bout of polio when she was thirteen, which isolated Mary in hospital, away from beloved family and friends for months. Recovery saw her turn to her one true passion - cookery. And so began a love affair that has - so far - spanned six remarkable decades; from demonstrating ovens in the early 1950s to producing glossy food magazines in the 60s and 70s, gradually becoming the country's most prolific and - many would say - best loved cookery writer. Until her emergence in the 21st century as a TV sensation and style icon on the Great British Bake Off . As a working mother, at the heart of a busy household, Mary became an expert at the art of juggling, even bringing her working life into her home with her Aga school. And there have been challenges, one terrible tragedy and many joys along the way. In this touching, evocative and fascinating memoir, we accompany Mary on her journey of nearly eighty years; a life lived to the full, with a wicked sense of fun and an eye for the absurd, it is the life of a delightfully traditional but thoroughly modern woman. Fans of The Great British Bake Off can't wait to get their hands on Mary Berry's Recipe for Life . Born in 1935, Mary has been teaching Britain how to cook for over half a century. Her far-reaching culinary career has taken her from recipe tester, cookery editor, author and entrepreneur to TV personality. Mary lives in Buckinghamshire with her husband Paul.",

      "Guitarist Robin Trower's watershed sophomore solo disc remains his most stunning, representative, and consistent collection of tunes. This 24-bit digitally remastered 25th anniversary reissue, which tacks on five live tracks adding nearly 25 minutes to the original playing time, improves upon the original. Mixing obvious Hendrix influences with blues and psychedelia, then adding the immensely soulful vocals of James Dewer, Robin Trower pushed the often-limited boundaries of the power trio concept into refreshing new waters. The concept gels best in the first track, \"Day of the Eagle,\" where the opening riff rocking morphs into the dreamy washes of gooey guitar chords that characterize the album's distinctive title track that follows. Track List: 1. Day of the Eagle 2. Bridge of Sighs 3. In This Place 4. The Fool and Me 5. Too Rolling Stoned 6. About to Begin 7. Lady Love 8. Little Bit of Sympathy 9. Bridge of Sighs 10. In This Place 11. Alethea 12. Little Bit of Sympathy 13. Fine Day 14. Confessin' Midnight 15. It's Only Money 16. Gonna Be More Suspicious",

      ", the launch novel for this thrilling new saga, New York Times bestselling author R. A. Salvatore takes the Star Wars universe to previously unscaled heights of action and imagination, expanding the beloved story of a galaxy far, far away . . .Twenty-one years have passed since the heroes of the Rebel Alliance destroyed the Death Star, breaking the power of the Emperor. Since then, the New Republic has valiantly struggled to maintain peace and prosperity among the peoples of the galaxy. But unrest has begun to spread; tensions erupt in outbreaks of rebellion that, if unchecked, threaten to destroy the Republic's tenuous reign.Into this volatile atmosphere comes Nom Anor, a charismatic firebrand who heats passions to the boiling point, sowing seeds of dissent for his own dark motives. In an effort to avert a catastrophic civil war, Leia travels with her daughter Jaina, her sister-in-law Mara Jade, and the loyal protocol droid C-3PO, to conduct face-to-face diplomatic negotiations with Nom Anor. But he proves resistant to Leia's entreaties--and, far more inexplicably, within the Force, where a being should be, was . . . blank space.Meanwhile, Luke is plagued by reports of rogue Jedi Knights who are taking the law into their own hands. And so he wrestles with a dilemma: Should he attempt, in this climate of mistrust, to reestablish the legendary Jedi Council?As the Jedi and the Republic focus on internal struggles, a new threat surfaces, unnoticed, beyond the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim. An enemy appears from outside known space, bearing weapons and technology unlike anything New Republic scientists have ever seen. Suddenly Luke, Mara, Leia, Han Solo, and Chewbacca--along with the Solo children--are thrust again into battle, to defend the freedom so many have fought and died for. But this time, all their courage, sacrifice, and even the power of the Force itself may not be enough. . . .",

      'It was too peaceful out here, surrounded by the vacuum of space and with only the continual hum of the twin ion drives breaking the silence. While she loved these moments of peace, Leia Organa Solo also viewed them as an emotional trap, for she had been around long enough to understand the turmoil she would find at the end of this ride.Like the end of every ride, lately.Leia paused a moment before she entered the bridge of the Jade Sabre, the new shuttle her brother, Luke, had built for his wife, Mara Jade. Before her, and apparently oblivious to her, Mara and Jaina sat comfortably, side by side at the controls, talking and smiling. Leia focused on her daughter, Jaina, sixteen years old, but with the mature and calm demeanor of a veteran pilot. Jaina looked a lot like Leia, with long dark hair and brown eyes contrasting sharply with her smooth and creamy skin. Indeed, Leia saw much of herself in the girl--no, not girl, Leia corrected her own thoughts, but young woman. That same sparkle behind the brown eyes, mischievous, adventurous, determined.That notion set Leia back a bit, for she recognized then that when she looked at Jaina, she was seeing not a reflection of herself but an image of the girl she had once been. A twinge of sadness caught her as she considered her own life now: a diplomat, a bureaucrat, a mediator, always trying to calm things down, always working for the peace and prosperity of the New Republic. Did she miss the days when the most common noise around her had been the sharp blare of a blaster or the hiss of a lightsaber? Was she sorry that those wild times had been replaced by the droning of the ion drives and the sharp bickering of one pride-wounded emissary after another?Perhaps, Leia had to admit, but in looking at Jaina and those simmering dark eyes, she could take vicarious pleasure.Another twinge--jealousy?--caught her by surprise, as Mara and Jaina erupted into laughter over some joke Leia had not overheard. But she pushed the absurd notion far from her mind as she considered her sister-in-law, Luke\'s wife and Jaina\'s tutor--at Jaina\'s own request--in the ways of the Jedi. Mara was not a substitute mother for Jaina, but rather, a big sister, and when Leia considered the fires that constantly burned in Mara\'s green eyes, she understood that the woman could give to Jaina things that Leia could not, and that those lessons and that friendship would prove valuable indeed to her daughter. And so she forced aside her jealousy and was merely glad that Jaina had found such a friend.She started onto the bridge, but paused again, sensing movement behind her. She knew before looking that it was Bolpuhr, her Noghri bodyguard, and barely gave him a glance as he glided to the side, moving so easily and gracefully that he reminded her of a lace curtain drifting lazily in a gentle breeze. She had accepted young Bolpuhr as her shadow for just that reason, for he was as unobtrusive as any bodyguard could be. Leia marveled at the young Noghri, at how his grace and silence covered a perfectly deadly fighting ability.She held up her hand, indicating that Bolpuhr should remain out here, and though his usually emotionless face did flash Leia a quick expression of disappointment, she knew he would obey. Bolpuhr, and all the Noghri, would do anything Leia asked of them. He would jump off a cliff or dive into the hot end of an ion engine for her, and the only time she ever saw any sign of discontentment with her orders was when Bolpuhr thought she might be placing him in a difficult position to properly defend her.As he was thinking now, Leia understood, though why in the world Bolpuhr would fear for her safety on her sister-in-law\'s private shuttle was beyond her. Sometimes dedication could be taken a bit too far.With a nod to Bolpuhr, she turned back to the bridge and crossed through the open doorway. "How much longer?" she asked, and was amused to see both Jaina and Mara jump in surprise at her sudden appearance.In answer, Jaina increased the magnification on the forward screen, and instead of the unremarkable dots of light, there appeared an image of two planets, one mostly blue and white, the other reddish in hue, seemingly so close together that Leia wondered how it was that the blue-and-white one, the larger of the pair, had not grasped the other in its gravity and turned it into a moon. Parked halfway between them, perhaps a half a million kilometers from either, deck lights glittering in the shadows of the blue-and-white planet, loomed a Mon Calamari battle cruiser, the Mediator, one of the newest ships in the New Republic fleet."They\'re at their closest," Mara observed, referring to the planets."I beg your indulgence," came a melodic voice from the doorway, and the protocol droid C-3PO walked into the room. "But I do not believe that is correct.""Close enough," Mara said. She turned to Jaina. "Both Rhommamool and Osarian are ground based, technologically--""Rhommamool almost exclusively so!" C-3PO quickly added, drawing a scowl from all three of the women. Oblivious, he rambled on. "Even Osarian\'s fleet must be considered marginal, at best. Unless, of course, one is using the Pantang Scale of Aero-techno Advancement, which counts even a simple landspeeder as highly as it would a Star Destroyer. Perfectly ridiculous scale.""Thank you, Threepio," Leia said, her tone indicating that she had heard more than enough."They\'ve both got missiles that can hit each other from this close distance, though," Mara continued."Oh, yes!" the droid exclaimed. "And given the proximity of their relative elliptical orbits--""Thank you, Threepio," Leia said."--they will remain within striking distance for some time," C-3PO continued without missing a beat. "Months, at least. In fact, they will be even closer in two standard weeks, the closest they will be to each other for a decade to come.""Thank you, Threepio!" Mara and Leia said together."And the closest they have been for a decade previous," the droid had to slip in, as the women turned back to their conversation.Mara shook her head, trying to remember her original point to Jaina. "That\'s why your mother chose to come out now.""You\'re expecting a fight?" Jaina asked, and neither Leia nor Mara missed the sparkle in her eye."The Mediator will keep them behaving," Leia said hopefully. Indeed, the battle cruiser was an impressive warship, an updated and more heavily armed and armored version of the Mon Calamari star cruiser.Mara looked back to the screen and shook her head, unconvinced. "It\'ll take more than a show of force to stop this catastrophe," she replied."Indeed, it has been escalating, by all reports," C-3PO piped up. "It started as a simple mining dispute over mineral rights, but now the rhetoric is more appropriate for some kind of a holy crusade.""It\'s the leader on Rhommamool," Mara remarked. "Nom Anor. He\'s reached down and grabbed his followers by their most basic instincts, weaving the dispute against Osarian into a more general matter of tyranny and oppression. Don\'t underestimate him.""I can\'t begin to give you a full list of tyrants like Nom Anor that I\'ve dealt with," Leia said with a resigned shrug."I have that very list available," C-3PO blurted. "Tonkoss Rathba of--""Thank you, Threepio," Leia said, too politely."Why, of course, Princess Leia," the droid replied. "I do so like to be of service. Now where was I? Oh, yes. Tonkoss Rathba of--""Not now, Threepio," Leia insisted, then to Mara, she added, "I\'ve seen his type often.""Not like him," Mara replied, somewhat softly, and the sudden weakness in her voice reminded Leia and Jaina that Mara, despite her nearly constant bravado and overabundance of energy, was seriously ill, with a strange and thankfully rare disease that had killed dozens of others and against which the best doctors in the New Republic had proven completely helpless. Of those who had contracted the molecular disorder, only Mara and one other remained alive, and that other person, being studied intently on Coruscant, was fast dying."Daluba," C-3PO went on. "And of course, there was Icknya--"Leia started to turn to the droid, hoping to politely but firmly shut him up, but Jaina\'s cry stopped her abruptly and swung her back to face the screen."Incoming ships!" Jaina announced, her voice full of surprise. The telltale blips had appeared on her sensor viewer as if from nowhere."Four of them," Mara confirmed. Even as she spoke, the warning buzzers began to go off. "From Osarian." She turned her curious expression up to Leia. "They know who we are?"Leia nodded. "And they know why I\'ve come.""Then they should know to leave us alone," Jaina reasoned.Leia nodded again, but understood better. She had come to the system not to meet with the Osarians--not at first, at least--but with their principal rival, Nom Anor, the cult figure stirring up trouble on Rhommamool. "Tell them to back off," she instructed Mara."Politely?" Mara asked, smiling, and with that dangerous twinkle in her eyes."New Republic shuttle," a halting voice crackled over the comm. "This is Captain Grappa of Osarian First-Force."With a flick of a switch, Mara put an image of the captain on the viewscreen, and Leia sighed as the green skin, spiny head ridge, and tapirlike snout came into view."Wonderful," she remarked sarcastically."The Osarians have hired Rodians?" Jaina asked.',

Suddenly Luke, Mara, Leia, Han Solo, and Chewbacca--along with the Solo children--are thrust again into battle, to defend the freedom so many have fought and died for. But this time, all their courage, sacrifice, and even the power of the Force itself may not be enough. . . .",

      "20-PAGE BOOKLET + CD. Includes new specially prepared liner notes by Penguin Guide to Jazz s writer BRIAN MORTON and by Paris prestigious JAZZ MAGAZINE. Tension is established within the ensemble and then gloriously discharged by Davis and Coltrane. The whole has a weightless and haunting quality, sustained by steady, unhurried tempos and a balance of sound that has rarely been equalled in the history of jazz recording. Kind of Blue is a record that almost everyone seems to own, but everyone should buy it again every few years and listen to it absolutely fresh. (PENGUIN GUIDE TO JAZZ). If there are indeed only a handful of albums that marked their own times in the way that Kind of Blue did, there are even less which, 60 years later, continue to bear the same importance. The members of this group would soon enter the firmament of jazz legends. The trumpeter was able to blend their contrasts, John Coltrane s fluid and burning breath, Bill Evans impressionist harmonies, in order to produce an album that is justly considered among the most precious in the history of recorded music.

      "Joni Mitchell is a songwriter, singer, musician, poet and painter. Her output of 19 albums over more than 25 years has created IMHO the most meaningful and consistent collection of work of any artist of her era. She's evolved from folk to pop to jazz to techno and back again, with touches of country and rock thrown in along the way, but in actuality none of these tags fit her, as she's always been marvelously unique and unclassifiable.  Tracklist:  1. Urge for Going  2. Chelsea Morning  3. Big Yellow Taxi  4. Woodstock  5. The Circle Game  6. Carey  7. California  8. You Turn Me on I\u2019m A Radio  9. Raised on Robbery  10. Help Me  11. Free Man in Paris  12. River  13. Chinese Caf\u00e9 / Unchained Melody  14. Come in From the Cold  15. Both Sides Now",

      'Produced and mixed by Nick Raskulinecz (Alice in Chains, Coheed & Cambria, Foo Fighters), and recorded and engineered by Paul "Fig" Figueroa (Alice in Chains, Bad Religion), Diamond Eyes is a powerful combination of muscular impact and expansive atmospherics clarity that charts the latest development in the band\'s ever growing sonic range. Opening with the title track\'s grinding riffs and near subliminal hook, the album\'s range encompasses the blowtorch attack of "CMND/CNTRL" and the sinister melancholy that underpins "Beauty School.\u201d As ever, the album blends the band\'s seamless ability to float between genres; "Sex Tape" glides with an eerie, discomforting beauty, while the combination of battering rhythms and Chino Moreno\u2019s harsh howl ensure that "Royal" demonstrates Deftones\' continuing ability to enthral with visceral sounds. Track List: 1. Diamond Eyes 2. Royal 3. CMND/CTRL 4. You\'ve Seen the Butcher 5. Beauty School 6. Prince 7. Rocket Skates 8. Sextape 9. Risk 10. 976-EVIL 11. This Place Is Death',

      "Michio Kaku is known as a popularizer of science and is quite good at it. One thing that I liked is the general absence of mathematical equations. The equations are important, of course, and if you want to learn more you have to get into them. But they are for the reasoning process of proof and are not necessary for understanding the implications of the results of the process. Kaku focuses on the interesting questions with a deep knowledge of science fiction, which he will be teaching online at CUNY during the coronavirus. These films include Independence Day, ET, Star Wars, Star Trek, Back to the Future, 2001 and its author Arthur C. Clarke, and the novels of H.G. Wells such as War of the Worlds, The Invisible Man, and Time Machine. In Star Wars we have things like the light sabres, the Death Star, the image of Princess Leia, hyperspace, and Kaku explains what those concepts would mean in real life. There's the question of time travel which has always fascinated mankind. The end of intelligent life on earth will come eventually-as the sun expands will we be able to go to other planets or stars? There's the question of extraterrestrial life and UFOs. Also telepathy or mind reading, multiverses, and teleportation. There's a fascinating story about a guy who was in the Philippines hundreds of years ago when Spain got there, and all of a sudden ended up in Mexico City! Catholics also have the phenomenon of bilocation in saints such as Padre Pio, and the faith in the Eucharist.",

      'Chicago was founded in 1967 by Walt Parazaider (woodwinds), James Pankow (trombone), Lee Loughnane (trumpet), Roert Lamm (keyboards and lead vocals), Terry Kath (guitar and lead vocals), and Danny Seraphine (drums). They called themselves The Big Thing. They added bassist-lead vocalist Peter Cetera and began working with their original producer-manager James William Guercio, subsequently becoming known as Chicago Transit Authority. Their self-titled 1969 debut release was an ambitious mix of free-form rock and horn-influenced jazz, the first of three double LPs that would start their career. The band dropped the "Transit Authority" and became known as simply "Chicago" on their second album in 1970, which was the first album to carry their trademark logo. CHICAGO II yielded some of the group\'s most enduring hits, which came from Pankow\'s suite "Ballet For A Girl In Buchannon," emulating the form of the great classical composers from a pop perspective. The album peaked at #4 on the Billboard charts. With the success of CHICAGO II, radio went back and discovered hits on the earlier CHICAGO TRANSIT AUTHORITY album. Their 1971 release CHICAGO III peaked at #2, driven by the success of the tracks "Free" and "Lowdown." These three classic Chicago albums can now be experienced from a new perspective with remastered sound and expanded liner notes.  Tracklist:  1. Introduction  2. Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?  3. Beginnings  4. Questions 67 and 68  5. Listen  6. Poem 58  7. Free Form Guitar  8. South California Purples  9. I\u2019m A Man  10. Prologue, August 29, 1968  11. Someday (August 29, 1968)  12. Liberation',

      "Bound together by lifelong friendship and shared experience for more than 25 years the Fishermen's Friends have met on the Platt (Harbour) in their native Port Isaac to raise money for charity, singing the traditional songs of the sea handed down to them by their forefathers. In 2010 they signed a major record deal and went Gold as they became the first traditional folk act to land a UK top ten album. The Fisherman's Friends have been widely credited with starting the revival of interest in shanty-style choral singing but a cornerstone of their success has been their constantly evolving and expanding repertoire. The strongest belief that the band have always held dear is that friendship will always come first, with music a very close second! Track List: 1. Rattlin' Winches 2. Yeller Girls 3. Mary Anne 4. Molly Mauk 5. Cousin Jack 6. Nelson's Blood 7. John Kanaka 8. The Last Leviathan 9. Sitting by The River 10. Sweet Maid of Madeira 11. Sail Away Ladies 12. Paddy Lay Back 13. Sally Brown 14.

      'It\'s been 20 years since Paul\'s Boutique came out, and to celebrate this landmark release Capitol has pressed it up onto a nice thick slab of 180g vinyl and bundled the whole thing in a quadruple-gatefold sleeve. The audio has also been fully restored, and this pressing sounds nice and crisp, much better than the old quieter pressings that have been floating around for years. The songs themselves are well known by now, but if you want a trip down memory lane check out "High Plains Drifter(1)" (probably my personal favorite), "Shake Your Rump(2)," "Hey Ladies(3)" or "Shadrach(4)."

      "Barbra Streisand's numerous awards and unparalleled accomplishments have made her one of the most recognized artists in the world today.

The artwork of this new collection salutes her 50 year achievement with a beautiful photograph from each decade of her career. Track List: 1. Woman in Love 2.

    description: [
      "The Life Of A Man, brings together the hits of Joe Cocker into the first comprehensive hits collection for 12 years, and the first package ever to cover his entire career from 1968 to his untimely passing in 2014. Cocker was raised on blues and grew up in Sheffield inspired by Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry and Lightnin Hopkins. These influences are evident in Cockers idiosyncratic style of vocals which adds a rough edge to the most delicate of melodies. Cocker began making a name for himself in the UK initially, with his prolific and powerful voice lending itself tastefully to love songs which lyrically juxtaposed with his gruff voice. This stunning collection features the international hit, With A Little Help From My Friends and the Grammy Award winning smash duet, Up Where We Belong. Click on the product image above to see the complete track listing.",

      'Opening with a few bars of Stravinsky to set the adoring crowd on its feet, this once-three-LP set is Yes at their finest. This was, after all, probably the most mainstream act that had even provisional "prog rock" status, and their tunes show it. While "Heart of the Sunrise" may be one of the more modestly titled Yes songs (compare it with "The Six Wives of Henry VIII" or "The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)" or even "Total Mass Retain"), it also bears marks of the band playing at its most frenetic pace around Jon Anderson\'s soaring near-falsetto. Rick Wakeman\'s grand synthesizer flashes are more than textural, finding visual meshes aplenty with Roger Dean\'s cryptic cover art--most of which is shrunken or absent on this two-CD reissue.  Tracklist:  Disc 1  1. Opening (Excerpt from "Firebird Suite")  2. Siberian Khatru  3. Heart of the Sunrise  4. Perpetual Change  5. And You and I: i. Cord of Life, ii. Eclipse, iii. The Preach  6. Mood for a Day  7. Excerpts from "The Six Wives of Henry VIII"  8. Roundabout   Disc 2  1. I\'ve Seen All Good People: a. Your Move, b. All Good People  2. Long Distance Runaround / The Fish (Schindleria Praemeturus)  3. Close to the Edge (I. The Solid Time of Change, II. Total Ma  4. Yours Is No Disgrace  5. Starship Trooper: a. Life Seeker, b.

      'Probably one of the most anticipated albums of the year, here is Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All leader Tyler, The Creator\'s second studio album. The lead single "Yonkers(1)" and the movement that Wolf Haley and his posse have spearheaded played a large role in all the hype behind Goblin, and the shock-and-awe rapper delivers exactly what his fans were expecting - nonsensical wordplay, vulgarity, don\'t-give-a-damn attitude, and lots of nightmare-fantasy lyrics over minimal and quirky homemade beats. Check out "Goblin(2)" where the 20-year old MC proclaims "I\'m not a fucking role model, I\'m a 19-year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams" or "Sandwitches(3)," a delightfully vile cut featuring Hodgy Beats. Also listen to "She(4)," "Transylvania(5)," "Window(6)," and "Tron Cat(7)" to get a sense of the "raw energy" that The Creator has been credited with (by everyone from ?uestlove to Jay-Z) injecting into hip-hop. 2LP gatefold, comes with free mp3 downloads, recommended.',

      "Death might be commonplace in 1857 in the Royal Free Hospital in London's Gray's Inn Road, but murder certainly isn't. When the body of Prudence Barrymore, a gently bred, dedicated and passionate nurse, is discovered stuffed into a laundry chute no one high born or low can be beyond suspicion. But the police seem determined to concentrate their efforts on proving Dr Kristian Beck the culprit because he is foreign. Concerned and unhappy with this state of affairs, Lady Callandra Daviot of the Board of Governers asks Investigator William Monk to pursue the case. Monk, frustrated by the lingering traces of amnesia caused by an accident, agrees, and calls upon his old colleagues to aid him. Hester Latterly, an independent young woman who served with Florence Nightingale in the Crimean War, knew the dead woman there; Hester's profession provides the perfect cover for her to obtain work at the Royal Free. And Oliver Rathbone, a brilliant barrister, who is brought in as counsel for the defence. But under the ever-present shadow of the gallows, and inching towards the appalling solution, the three begin to despair of justice ever prevailing.",

      "In the Philippines, a ragtag American guerrilla army battles the Japanese, under a most unusual commander. In Budapest, an agent must keep two key prisoners from being interrogated by the Gestapo, his only choices being to rescue them - or kill them. In Washington, an Army Air Corps captain suddenly finds himself assigned deep under the sea, his mission an improbable one of submarines, supplies, arms, and gold. And in Cairo, an undistinguished pilot named Darmstadter wonders why in the world the OSS is interested in his services, only to find out in the most dramatic way possible - and to become a hero in the process. Fourth in the MEN AT WAR series.",

    description: [
      'LIMITED DELUXE EDITION PACKAGE INCLUDES TWO EXCLUSIVE BONUS TRACKS. Kisses On The Bottom is a collection of standards Paul grew up listening to in his childhood as well as the two new McCartney compositions "My Valentine" and "Only Our Hearts." With the help of Grammy Award-winning producer Tommy LiPuma and Diana Krall and her band--as well as guest appearances from Eric Clapton and Stevie Wonder, McCartney\'s new album is a deeply personal journey through classic American compositions that, in some cases, a young Paul first heard his father perform on piano at home. This limited edition version includes the exclusive bonus tracks "Baby\'s Request" and "My One And Only Love." Track Listing: 1. I\'m Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter 2. Home (When Shadows Fall) 3. It\'s Only A Paper Moon 4. More I Cannot Wish You 5. The Glory Of Love 6. We Three (My Echo, My Shadow And Me) 7. Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive 8. My Valentine 9.

      "After years of admiring each other's musical masterworks, guitar great J.J. Cale and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer/Grammy-winner Eric Clapton have teamed up to create an original album together called The Road to Escondido. The resulting hybrid sound defies labels, and instead finds influence across the spectrum of blues, rock, country, and fold. The songs are warm and rich with deep-flowing rhythms while using an economy of words to express much. Track List: 1. Danger 2. Heads in Georgia 3. Missing Person 4. When the War Is Over 5. Sporting Life Blues 6. Dead End Road 7. It's Easy 8. Hard to Thrill 9. Anyway the Wind Blows 10. Three Little Girls 11. Don't Cry Sister 12. Last Will and Testament 13. Who Am I Telling You?  14.

      "An adventure set at the height of the French Revolution, from the bestselling author of Under Enemy Colours Charles Hayden sets off aboard the ill-fated HMS Themis with orders to destroy a French frigate and to gather intelligence from a royalist spy. On discovering French plans for an imminent invasion of England, Hayden must return to Portsmouth to give warning before it's too late. But the enemy have been lying in wait for him, and so begins a dangerous chase out into the Atlantic and into the clutches of a powerful French squadron\u2026 Hayden and his men try in desperation to warn the Lords of the Admiralty. Failure will mean the invasion of England - and the guillotine for Hayden. This recording is unabridged. Typically abridged audiobooks are not more than 60% of the author's work and as low as 30% with characters and plotlines removed.",

From her early days in South Shields, against the background of the miner's strike, through to her marriage, her early days at writing workshops where her creative talent emerged, to today's top performer, it's a heartwarming and inspiring story.

      "\"My Life\" di Bill Clinton, ex presidente degli Stati Uniti, racconta una storia intensamente americana; quella di un uomo che decide di mettersi al servizio del proprio paese e compie l'improbabile viaggio da un'oscura cittadina dell'Arkansas fino alla Casa Bianca. In uno straordinario intreccio di pubblico e privato, di storia e memoria, nell'incessante rincorrersi di ricordi personali e documenti d'archivio, queste pagine ci svelano il cuore e la mente dell'uomo che \u00e8 stato per un decennio il protagonista assoluto del panorama politico internazionale.",

      "Product Description",
      "'A long, oily blackness punctuated by quick, vivid dreams ...They were all just dreams. She couldn't possibly see these things, could she? Her eyes were closed. And if they really happened, then she would have screamed out from the pain, wouldn't she?' On a balmy June night, Kirsten, a young university student, strolls home through a silent moonlit park. Suddenly, her tranquil mood is shattered as she is viciously attacked. When she awakes in hospital, she has no recollection of that brutal night. But then, slowly and painfully, details reveal themselves - dreams of two figures, one white and one black, hovering over her, wisps of a strange and haunting song; the unfamiliar texture of a rough and deadly hand...In another part of England, Martha Browne arrives in Whitby, posing as an author doing research for a book. But her research is of a particularly macabre variety. Who is she hunting with such deadly determination? And why?",
      "Review",
      "Written back in 1990 but previously unpublished in the UK, this is one of Peter Robinson's earliest books. Taking a break from Inspector Banks he decided to write a book based on the victim's perspective rather than a police procedural. This creepy, suspenseful book was the result. Set on the Yorkshire coast, Martha Browne is supposedly researching a book whilst further inland a spate of student murders is causing a serial killer scare amongst the universities of the North. Flitting between Kirsten, the one survivor of the serial killer, and Martha, Robinson slowly but surely builds up the tension page by page. No stopping at the end of any chapter here, it is definitely a one-sitting read. Characteristically Yorkshire-based with detailed descriptions of the locations to draw the reader in, the writing is taut and tantalising displaying Robinson's skills at writing from the other side of the coin. A must for all Robinson fans. - Lucy Watson",

    description: [
      "Anna Pigeon, a Ranger with the National Park Service, is on administrative leave from her job as she recovers from the traumas of the past couple of months \u2013 while the physical wounds have healed, the emotional ones are still healing. With her new husband busy and back at work, Anna decides to go to stay with an old friend from the Park Service, Geneva, who works as a singer at the New Orleans Jazz National Historic Park. Anna isn\u2019t in town long before she crosses paths with a tenant of Geneva\u2019s, a creepy guy named Jordan. She discovers what seems to be an attempt to place a curse on her \u2013 a gruesomely killed pigeon marked with runic symbols \u2013 and begins slowly to find traces of very dark doings in the heart of post-Katrina New Orleans. Tied up in all of this evil magic are Jordan, who is not at all what he appears to be; a fugitive mother accused of killing her husband and daughters in a fire; and faint whispers of unpleasant goings-on in the heart of the slowly recovering city. Now it will take all of Anna\u2019s skills learned in the untamed outdoors to navigate the urban jungle in which she finds herself, to uncover the threads that connect these seemingly disparate people, and to rescue the most vulnerable of creatures from the most savage of animals.",

With David Angel\'s atmospheric string and horn arrangements giving the work a conceptual underpinning, Lee explores mainstream America\'s penchant for paranoia ("The Red Telephone") and violence ("A House Is Not a Motel") with songs that are as sonically subtle and lilting as they are lyrically blunt and harrowing. Add two gems by Love\'s secret weapon, second guitarist',

      "Alice Cooper's Welcome to My Nightmare became a dream come true for the legendary shock rocker and his fans; his first solo album, it soared to #5 in 1975 and became a '70s rock classic. His hits Only Women Bleed; Department of Youth, and Welcome to My Nightmare join the rest of the original LP, and this remastered reissue (the album has never sounded so good!) tacks on three bonus tracks. Rock 'n' roll!  Tracklist:  1. Welcome to My Nightmare  2. Devil's Food  3. The Black Widow  4. Some Folks  5. Only Women Bleed  6. Department of Youth  7. Cold Ethyl  8. Years Ago  9. Steven  10.

The brand new album from Eros is dedicated to his close friend, the artist with whom Eros shared personal moments and many emotions, Pino Daniele, and comes after the release of the homonymous single, which, in just over a month, hit the top of the Italian and international radio charts. VITA CE N'E, the fifteenth studio album, is a positive record, where \"love is at the centre of all the optimism in which we can all still believe\".

    description: [
      'Four years after her return to recording after a much-publicized battle with drug addiction, Natalie Cole found herself unexpectedly experiencing a virtual reinvention as a bestselling artist and performer, thanks to a project she had longed to do for many years. Unforgettable with Love was the soulful singer\'s way of paying tribute to her late, legendary father, Nat "King" Cole, and marked her label debut for Elektra Records. Cole, Elektra, and the album\'s producers--including then-husband Andre Fischer and Tommy LiPuma--were rewarded with a multiple-Grammy-winning set that sold an astonishing 5 million copies in the U.S. alone. Cole\'s selections varied from obvious choices like "Mona Lisa," "Nature Boy," "Route 66," and "Straighten Up and Fly Right"--all major hits for her father in the \'50s--to more obscure parts of King Cole\'s repertoire, such as "Avalon" and "Non Dimenticar." The crowning glory was a "duet" with her father, electronically created using his original vocal, which helped expand Cole\'s audience dramatically and took her career to a new plateau.',

      'For his highly anticipated 1971 solo debut, David Crosby recorded a unique, eclectic, and willfully expansive album. The cream of early-70s California rock is assembled here, with the various celebrities joining together in an organic, collective approach that\'s embodied in the opener, the free-spirited jam of "Music Is Love". Throughout the record, Crosby moves from the sauntering Western shuffle of "Cowboy Movie" to the wondrously spiritual harmonies of "Tamalpais High (At About 3)" and, eventually, the hallowed chants of "I\'d Swear There Was Somebody Here". Musically the album has an exploratory, almost jazzy feel, with its bright production cloaking the listener in acoustic strains and lush, layered harmonies. Track List: 1. Music Is Love 2. Cowboy Movie 3. Tamalpais High (At About 3)  4. Laughing 5. What Are Their Names 6. Traction in The Rain 7. Song with No Words (Tree with No Leaves)  8. Orleans 9.

The best-known source of investment advice in America today, Jim Cramer explains how to invest wisely in chaotic times, and he does so in a way that is as much fun as investing is -- or should be, when it's done right.

He tells you how to: * compare stock prices in a way that you can understand * spot market tops and bottoms * know when to sell * rotate among cyclical stocks to catch the big moves * and much more. Drawing on information that Cramer himself has used to make millions on Wall Street, Jim Cramer's Real Money is filled with insider advice that really works.",

      '(Random House, Inc, New York, 2006, 8 compact discs, 10 hours) Like New condition. Excellent set with no markings on case holder or on CDs. It is in superb listening condition. It has been in my personal collection for almost 15 years. It was just listened to once and then sat on the shelf. The back cover of the case: \u201cSeven years in the making and meticulously researched, here is the definitive portrait of one of the most important figures in American entertainment and cultural history. From the young Walt Disney breaking free of a heartland childhood to the visionary whose desire for escape honed an innate sense of what people wanted to see on the screen, witness Disney reinvent animation, first with Mickey Mouse and then with his feature films, from a novelty based on movement to an art from that presented an illusion of life. Gabler reveals a wounded, lonely, and often disappointed man who at times retreated into pitiable seclusion in his model train workshop, yet still reshaped the entertainment industry by building a synergistic empire in a way that was unprecedented and later widely imitated. This is a masterly biography, a revelation of both the work and the man--of both the remarkable accomplishments and the hidden life."',

As Ever struggles to keep the Immortals hidden, it only propels Haven closer to the enemy\u2014Roman and his evil companions. At the same time, Ever delves deeper into dark magick to free Damen from Roman\u2019s power. But when her spell backfires, it binds her to the one guy who\u2019s hell-bent on her destruction. Now there\u2019s a strange, foreign pulse coursing through her, and no matter what she does, she can\u2019t stop thinking about Roman\u2014and longing for his touch.

      "The greatest of all Civil War campaigns, Gettysburg was the turning point of the turning point in our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history. Volumes have been written about this momentous three-day battle, but recent histories have tended to focus on the particulars rather than the big picture: on the generals or on single days of battle \u2014 even on single charges \u2014 or on the daily lives of the soldiers. In Gettysburg Sears tells the whole story in a single volume. From the first gleam in Lee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye to the last Rebel hightailing it back across the Potomac, every moment of the battle is brought to life with the vivid narrative skill and impeccable scholarship that has made Stephen Sears\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other histories so successful. Based on years of research, this is the first book in a generation that brings everything together, sorts it all out, makes informed judgments, and takes stands. Even the most knowledgeable of Civil War buffs will find fascinating new material and new interpretations, and Sears\u00e2\u0080\u0099s famously accessible style will make the book just as appealing to the general reader. In short, this is the one book on Gettysburg that anyone interested in the Civil War should own.",

Additionally, guitarist and songwriter Lindsey Buckingham, who, like Nicks, enjoyed a solo career in addition to putting in time with Fleetwood Mac, is also represented here with excellent songs, including "Go Your Own Way" and "Tusk." This is an excellent primer for anyone unfamiliar with one of the most successful pop bands of a generation.  Tracklist:  1. Rhiannon 2. Go Your Own Way 3. Don\'t Stop 4. Gypsy 5. Everywhere 6.

      "Product Description",
      "Over 50 rare nuggets from the Fab Four's earliest (1958-1964) days, included the fabled Decca audition tape that the label, to it's eternal dismay, rejected, plus early Quarrymen recordings (That'll Be the Day), a version of Love Me Do with Pete Best on drums, a demo of Can't Buy Me Love, You Know What to Do (the second song George ever wrote) and many more essential, oft-bootlegged-but-never-sounding-so-good Beatles rarities.",
      "Amazon.com",
      'This is the first release in a three-part series that essentially amounted to the three surviving Beatles officially sanctioning the release of tracks that had been bootlegged for years. Thus, you get some of their earliest recordings as teens; the tracks they cut in Hamburg, Germany; their Decca audition tapes (which were rejected); and, finally, alternate takes and works in progress of songs that are now part of the world\'s consciousness. Oh, yeah, you also get "Free As a Bird," the John Lennon track the other Beatles "finished" in 1995; it\'s out of context in the company of some of the group\'s early classics. Beatlemaniacs, of course, love exploring this stuff, but the three Anthologies are hardly a place for beginners to start their explorations.',

      "Digitally remastered edition of this ground-breaking 1970 album. Derek & The Dominos were the almost fictional group recruited by Eric Clapton which came together during the sessions for George Harrison's \u201cAll Things Must Pass\u201d album in 1970. The band released only this one studio album in December 1970, which has been re-evaluated since its release and is now regarded as one of Clapton's finest recordings and is often considered to be the defining achievement of Clapton's career. The album melded an astounding collection of musical styles - Blues, Folk, R&B and Rock - into one timeless package. It consistently appears in listings of the best rock albums ever recorded, and was finally inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2000 and continuous to be noticed by critics. Track List: 1. I Looked Away  2. Bell Bottom Blues 3. Keep on Growing  4. Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out  5. I Am Yours  6. Anyday  7. Key to The Highway  8. Tell the Truth  9. Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?  10. Have You Ever Loved A Woman 11. Little Wing 12. It's Too Late 13. Layla 14. Thorn Tree in The Garden",

      "On Parrish Island, a restricted island off the coast of Virginia, there is a little known and never visited psychiatric facility. There, far from prying eyes, the government stores former intelligence employees whose psychiatric state make them a danger to their own government. One of these employees, former Consular Operations agent Hal Ambler, is kept heavily medicated and closely watched. But there's one difference between Hal and the other patients-Hal isn't crazy. With the help of a sympathetic nurse, Hal manages to first clear his mind of the drug-induced haze and then pulls off a daring escape. Free, he's out to discover who stashed him there and why-but the world he returns to isn't the one he remembers. Friends and longtime associates don't remember him, there are no official records of Hal Ambler, and when he first sees himself in the mirror, the face that looks back at him is not the one he knows as his own.",

Winter 1793 - Master and Commander Charles Hayden's orders are to return to the ill-fated frigate, HMS Themis. Placed in temporary command, he is to join the escort for the last convoy of the season - braving the wintry seas. Hayden's uncanny knack for attracting the attention of the French navy sees the Themis thrown back into action only hours out of port. Soon, Hayden's captaincy and military skill are stretched to their utmost as he finds himself at the vanguard of this brutal clash of empires. This recording is unabridged. Typically abridged audiobooks are not more than 60 per cent of the author's work and as low as 30 per cent with characters and plotlines removed.",

      "On April 12, nine-time GRAMMY-winning singer-songwriter Norah Jones is releasing Begin Again, a collection of singles that gathers seven eclectic songs that Jones has recorded over the past year with collaborators including Jeff Tweedy and Thomas Bartlett. Begin Again will be released on 12\u201d vinyl, CD, and as a digital album and features the new song \u201cJust a Little Bit,\u201d which was produced by Jones and features her on vocals, piano, and organ along with Brian Blade on drums, Christopher Thomas on bass, Dave Guy on trumpet, and Leon Michels on tenor saxophone. The singles Jones began releasing last summer ran the gamut from riveting electronic experiments to starkly acoustic folk ballads to organ-and-horn drenched soul songs. With the addition of three more previously unreleased songs, Begin Again presents seven snapshots of creativity from one of the music world\u2019s most versatile and consistently intriguing artists. Tracklisting: 1. My Heart Is Full 2. Begin Again 3. It Was You 4. A Song with No Name 5. Uh Oh 6. Wintertime 7. Just A Little Bit",

      "This item is a CD. Digitally remastered edition of this 1987 release from the legendary British quartet, their final studio album. With producer Stephen Street, The Smiths created a subtly shaded and skilled album, one boasting a fuller production than before. Morrissey and Marr labored hard over the songs, working to expand the band's sound within their boundaries. In doing so they created the classic tracks \"I Started Something I Couldn't Finish,\" \"Girlfriend in a Coma,\" \"Stop Me if You Think You've Heard This One Before,\" and \"I Won't Share You.\u201d This, the highest charting of all their albums, easily offers a summary of the band's considerable strengths.  Tracklist:  1. A Rush and a Push and the Land Is Ours  2. I Started Something I Couldn't Finish  3. Death of a Disco Dancer  4. Girlfriend in a Coma  5. Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before  6. Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me  7. Unhappy Birthday  8. Paint a Vulgar Picture 9. Death at One's Elbow  10. I Won't Share You",

      "Miles: The Autobiography, like Miles himself, holds nothing back. For the first time Miles talks about his five-year silence. He speaks frankly and openly about his drug problem and how he overcame it. He condemns the racism he has encountered in the music business and in American society generally. And he discusses the women in his life. But above all, Miles talks about music and musicians, including the legends he has played with over the years. Narrated by Dion Graham from HBO's the Wire.",

Although "Yours to Hold," " The Older I Get," and "Say Goodbye" aren\'t that different their original versions "Rebirthing" and "Whispers in the Dark" are extremely different, both putting forward a slightly darker sound. The new song "Live Free or Let Me Die" is almost worth the repurchase in and of itself. The way the lyrics are constructed is very similar to "Rebirthing" while the music has a lot in common with "Better then Drugs."',

      "Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter Beth Hart has already moved guitar legends Jeff Beck, Slash, Joe Bonamassa and Buddy Guy to perform with her on records and live. The UK have firmly taken Beth to their hearts after recent stirring headline performances at the Royal Albert Hall, The Roundhouse and Hampton Court Palace. Now on her 7th solo record, album collaborations with Joe Bonamassa, \u2018Seesaw\u2019 and \u2018Don\u2019t Explain\u2019, made it to the top #1 and #3 of the Billboard Blues Albums Chart whilst \u2018Live in Amsterdam\u2019 entered the UK album chart at #18, . Her greatest validation as one of the defining voices of our time came when her tribute (alongside Jeff Beck) to Buddy Guy on The Kennedy Center Honors Special received one of the only 2 standing ovations of the evening, led by President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle. She has also worked with Guns \u2018n Roses guitar maestro Slash on \u2018Mother Maria\u2019 from his album \u2018Slash\u2019. Includes bonus track 'Mama This One's For You'",

      "FEAR (F*** Everyone And Run) is the band s eighteenth studio album and features 5 brand new tracks. The feeling within the band themselves is that they may well have produced their best ever work. Marillion has certainly not mellowed with age; the album artwork shows the acronym FEAR embossed on a gold ingot, and the songs themselves bear the hallmark of true quality.While the album title itself is certainly provocative, it s not meant to be offensive. The title itself features as a line in the track New Kings and is delivered as a plaintive falsetto. Steve Hogarth said, We ve used FEAR as a title with some relish, but only as it shows that we haven t shied away, but it s said with sadness. There are two basic impulses behind human behaviour: Love and Fear, and all the good stuff comes from love . FEAR sees the band taking on the big themes but they do not see it as their place to preach to people. New Kings looks at the ravening beast that modern capitalism seems to have evolved into, El Dorado examines the notions of political entitlement and the modern challenges for the UK, The Leavers examines the impact of a transient life on the road for those constantly waving goodbye. The job is simple says Hogarth, We use the amazing privilege of having both a platform and an audience to encourage people to look in the mirror and ask themselves the big questions by doing just that ourselves .With the final tinkering and finessing done, with FEAR. Marillion show that they are as vital and potent as ever. Peerless and, yes, fearless...Available CD (Standard, Tour Edition & Super Audio CD), Vinyl and Digital.CD 11. Eldoradoi.

      "Damnation is a complex and often acoustic album that demonstrates beyond question Opeth's high regard for the sweet harmonies and post-psychedelic atmospherics of '70s rockers such as Camel, Steve Hackett, and, especially, Barclay James Harvest. Then there's Opeth's own pedigree. Steeped in the bloodier aspects of metal, singer Mikael Akerfeldt has no time for sweet love or fanciful flights of fantasy; he's trapped in post-relationship depression, drowning in loneliness and regret. Track List: 1. Windowpane 2. In My Time of Need 3. Death Whispered a Lullaby 4. Closure 5. Hope Leaves 6. To Rid the Disease 7. Ending Credits (instrumental)  8. Weakness",

"I Left My Heart in San Francisco" makes it\'s appearance midway and the increase in confidence and authority in Bennett\'s performances after this milestone is readily apparent. From this moment on, Tony Bennett "owns" just about any song he sings, as his definitive versions of "Who Can I Turn To," and "For Once in My Life" amply demonstrate.',

      'For those not inclined towards Bennett\'s 4-disc anthology 40 YEARS, this album collection from 1972 is a solid survey of all the singer\'s hits going all the way back to 1951, including "Rags to Riches" and the castanet-driven. "I Left My Heart in San Francisco" makes its appearance midway and the increase in confidence and authority in Bennett\'s performances after this milestone is readily apparent. From this moment on, Tony Bennett "owns" just about any song he sings, as his definitive versions of "Who Can I Turn To," and "For Once in My Life" amply demonstrate.

      "We were fortunate with this one. Fortunate you say? How so? Well for starters, the late and lauded mastering engineer George Marino at Sterling Sound mastered and cut the original 1975 release of Ted Nugent. Almost 40 years later, after some digging by George's protege, Ryan Smith, on behalf of this Analogue Productions reissue \u2014 lo and behold \u2014 George's mastering notes resurfaced as well as the original analog tape masters. With the release of Ted Nugent, the self-proclaimed Motor City Madman and god of gonzo guitar became not just a star, but one of rock 'n' roll's icons. The songs \"Motor City Madhouse\" and \"Just What The Doctor Ordered\" would become two of many of Ted's road anthems. These and the other 10 monster tracks on Ted Nugent were clear evidence that Ted was an artist to be reckoned with. Ted Nugent still likes to reflect back on what his critics were saying as he put his band, the Amboy Dukes, to rest and started the next phase of his career\u2014one that would be under his own vision, his own direction and most importantly, his own name.",

      'In 1985 members of Duran Duran took a hiatus from their hectic career to produce two very different bands and albums, the first being Arcadia comprised of Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes, and Roger Taylor, the second being the guitar driven rock of the Power Station with John and Andy Taylor (along with Robert Palmer and Tony Thompson). Arcadia, created between the Arena and Notorious albums, it was originally going to be a project of "remakes" much like Duran Duran\'s 1996 release Thank You. What it became was a much more eloquent version of Duranie synth pop. This album gained recognition from the sheer Duran connection, however, it featured some of the most stylishly written pop tunes and produced four singles. Track List: 1. Election Day 2. Keep Me in the Dark 3. Goodbye Is Forever 4. The Flame 5. Missing 6. Rose Arcana 7. The Promise 8. El Diablo 9. Lady Ice',

      "Ms. Baez's most successful album, artistically and commercially... and she recorded it on her own terms and direction. The material she chose to cover includes songs originally by Jackson Browne, Stevie Wonder, her forever love Bob Dylan and the Allman Brothers. But it was the title track that must have brought her the most satisfaction, as it was self-penned. An ode to her fabled affair with Dylan, it speaks from the heart frankly, affectionately and unapologetically. She was rewarded with it becoming a Top 40 hit (something that had eluded her since the 1960's), one of the biggest in her career. Musicians include Crusaders Wilton Felder and Joe Sample along with Larry Carlton, as well as Joni Mitchell (with Tom Scott & the L.A. Express) who duets on \"Di Da.\u201d Track List: 1.

      "We are a nation battered every day by stories about horrific calamities, tragic events, frightening statistics. Inevitably our thoughts turn personal and we wonder if we have what it takes to get through the worst thrown our way. While there are plenty of books about coping with adversity, it isn't until now, with WHO SURVIVES, that we discover the human factors that determine survival. It's a combination instruction audiobook and security blanket that blends compelling true stories with cutting-edge science to deliver some of the most important lessons we'll ever need to learn. The book will: --list the most important traits necessary for survival (Fear is #1.) --identify the 5 types of survivors --debunk myths (like only the strong survive), explore the frontiers of survival science (How much strain and punishment can a human body endure?), and introduce readers to counterintuitive thinking (Ever heard of posttraumatic growth?) --provide a Survivors Tool Kit, including an online test that measures one's Survivor's Quotient Each one of us eventually joins the club of millions who face life's inescapable tribulations and tragedies. WHO SURVIVES is the companion we need to prepare us for and guide us through the worst.",

      'The album serves as a follow-up to the 2014 LP "YES!," and is Mraz\'s first full-length studio recording in over four years. The bulk of the album was written against the backdrop of the 2016 Presidential election and its aftermath, and Mraz found himself writing a lot of "frustrated, angry, even sad songs, but nothing I wanted to sing." Instead he has chosen to convey an uplifting, positive message. Know. was produced by Andrew Wells, who brings an organic and groovy feel to the album\'s classic, acoustic rock sound.  Tracklist:  1. Let\'s See What the Night Can Do  2. Have It All  3. More Than Friends (feat. Meghan Trainor)  4. Unlonely  5. Better with You  6. No Plans  7. Sleeping to Dream  8. Making It Up  9. Might as Well Dance  10. Love is Still the Answer',

      "Here's something all the critics can agree on: Elvis Costello's first three albums are among the greatest records ever made.

During a brief but intensely creative five year existence Free recorded some of the most exciting, primal and emotive hard rock of all time.

Comprising hit songs and catalog gems, this collection reveals why Free were quite probably the first and greatest blues-rock band of them all. Free was one of the biggest-selling British rock groups of all time, reaching over 20 million album sales.",

      "Drawing together the best of Gary Moore's four recent blues albums, along with the unforgettable \"Parisienne Walkways 93\" and a whole bonus CD of live tracks, Gary Moore: The Best of the Blues, is essential listening for the army of Gary Moore followers and all fans of the blues. 1990 was a watershed in the career of Gary Moore. It was the year that the virtuoso guitarist turned his back on the rock guitar that had made his name and returned to playing his true love, the blues. He released Still Got the Blues, the first of four highly successful blues albums, and became one of the true superstars of the genre. After Hours, Blues Alive and Blues for Greeny, his tribute to Peter Green, followed, and his collaborations with blues legends Albert King, Albert Collins and BB King further enhanced this reputation. Track List: Disc 1 1. Walking By Myself 2. Oh Pretty Woman 3. Still Got The Blues (Full Version)  4. Separate Ways 5. Since I Met You Baby 6. Story Of The Blues (Single Edit)  7. All Your Love 8. Too Tired 9. Need Your Love So Bad (Single Edit)  10. Midnight Blues 11. King Of The Blues 12. Jumpin' At Shadows 13. Texas Strut 14. Moving On 15. Stop Messin' Around 16. Parissiene Walkways-'93 17. The Supernatural Disc 2 1. Caldonia (Live)  2. You Don't Love Me (Live)  3. Key To Love (Live)  4. The Thrill Is Gone (Live)  5. Stormy Monday (Live)  6. Cold, Cold Feeling (Live)  7.

      "For former hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, words are the most powerful weapon in the human arsenal. For good and for evil, as was the case in the spring of 1994 in Rwanda. Over 100 days, some 800,000 people were slaughtered, most hacked to death by machete. Rusesabagina\u2014inspiration for the movie",
      "Hotel Rwanda",
      "\u2014used his facility with words and persuasion to save 1,268 of his fellow countrymen, turning the Belgian luxury hotel under his charge into a sanctuary from madness. Through negotiation, favor, flattery and deception, Rusesabagina managed to keep his \"guests\" alive another day despite the homicidal gangs just beyond the fence and the world's failure to act. Narrator Hoffman delivers those words in a stirring audio performance. With a crisp African accent, Hoffman renders each sentence with heartfelt conviction and flat-out becomes Rusesabagina. The humble hotel manager not only illuminates the machinery behind the genocide but delves into Rwanda's complex and colorful cultural history as well as his own childhood, the son of a Hutu father and Tutsi mother. Hoffman successfully draws out the understated elegance of Rusesabagina's simple and straightforward prose, lending the story added vividness. This tale of good, evil and moral responsibility winds down with Rusesabagina visiting a church outside Kigali where thousands were massacred and where a multilingual sign-cloth now pledges, \"Never Again.\" He once more stops to consider words, the ones he worries lack true conviction\u2014like those at the church\u2014as well as the ones with the power to heal. For the listener, the words of Paul Rusesabagina won't soon be forgotten. Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

And Tarrou, Rieux, and their friends might give one answer or another, but its conclusion was always the same, their certitude that a fight must be put up, in this way or that, and there must be no bowing down. The essential thing was to save the greatest possible number of persons from dying and being doomed to unending separation. And to do this there was only one resource: to fight the plague. There was nothing admirable about this attitude; it was merely logical.\u201d",

      "This is a work of nonfiction. All of the people and events described herein are true as I remember them. For legal and ethical reasons, I have given pseudonyms to a handful of private Rwandan citizens. Each time this is done, the change is noted in the text.",
      "Paul Rusesabagina",
      "INTRODUCTION",
      "My name is Paul Rusesabagina. I am a hotel manager. In April 1994, when a wave of mass murder broke out in my country, I was able to hide 1, 268 people inside the hotel where I worked.",
      "When the militia and the Army came with orders to kill my guests, I took them into my office, treated them like friends, offered them beer and cognac, and then persuaded them to neglect their task that day. And when they came back, I poured more drinks and kept telling them they should leave in peace once again. It went on like this for seventy-six days. I was not particularly eloquent in these conversations. They were no different from the words I would have used in saner times to order a shipment of pillow-cases, for example, or tell the shuttle van driver to pick up a guest at the airport. I still don\u2019t understand why those men in the militias didn\u2019t just put a bullet in my head and execute every last person in the rooms upstairs but they didn\u2019t. None of the refugees in my hotel were killed. Nobody was beaten. Nobody was taken away and made to disappear. People were being hacked to death with machetes all over Rwanda, but that five-story building became a refuge for anyone who could make it to our doors. The hotel could offer only an illusion of safety, but for whatever reason, the illusion prevailed and I survived to tell the story, along with those I sheltered. There was nothing particularly heroic about it. My only pride in the matter is that I stayed at my post and continued to do my job as manager when all other aspects of decent life vanished. I kept the Hotel Mille Collines open, even as the nation descended into chaos and eight hundred thousand people were butchered by their friends, neighbors, and countrymen.",
      "It happened because of racial hatred. Most of the people hiding in my hotel were Tutsis, descendants of what had once been the ruling class of Rwanda. The people who wanted to kill them were mostly Hutus, who were traditionally farmers. The usual stereotype is that Tutsis are tall and thin with delicate noses, and Hutus are short and stocky with wider noses, but most people in Rwanda fit neither description. This divide is mostly artificial, a leftover from history, but people take it very seriously, and the two groups have been living uneasily alongside each other for more than five hundred years.",
      "You might say the divide also lives inside me. I am the son of a Hutu farmer and his Tutsi wife. My family cared not the least bit about this when I was growing up, but since bloodlines are passed through the father in Rwanda, I am technically a Hutu. I married a Tutsi woman, whom I love with a fierce passion, and we had a child of mixed descent together. This type of blended family is typical in Rwanda, even with our long history of racial prejudice. Very often we can\u2019t tell each other apart just by looking at one another. But the difference between Hutu and Tutsi means everything in Rwanda. In the late spring and early summer of 1994 it meant the difference between life and death.",
      "Between April 6, when the plane of President Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down with a missile, and July 4, when the Tutsi rebel army captured the capital of Kigali, approximately eight hundred thousand Rwandans were slaughtered. This is a number that cannot be grasped with the rational mind. It is like trying\u2014all at once\u2014to understand that the earth is surrounded by billions of balls of gas just like our sun across a vast blackness. You cannot understand the magnitude. Just try! Eight hundred thousand lives snuffed out in one hundred days. That\u2019s eight thousand lives a day. More than five lives per minute. Each one of those lives was like a little world in itself. Some person who laughed and cried and ate and thought and felt and hurt just like any other person, just like you and me. A mother\u2019s child, every one irreplaceable.",
      "And the way they died \u2026I can\u2019t bear to think about it for long. Many went slowly from slash wounds, watching their own blood gather in pools in the dirt, perhaps looking at their own severed limbs, oftentimes with the screams of their parents or their children or their husbands in their ears. Their bodies were cast aside like garbage, left to rot in the sun, shoveled into mass graves with bulldozers when it was all over. It was not the largest genocide in the history of the world, but it was the fastest and most efficient.",
      "At the end, the best you can say is that my hotel saved about four hours\u2019 worth of people. Take four hours away from one hundred days and you have an idea of just how little I was able to accomplish against the grand design.",
      "What did I have to work with? I had a five-story building. I had a cooler full of drinks. I had a small stack of cash in the safe. And I had a working telephone and I had my tongue. It wasn\u2019t much. Anybody with a gun or a machete could have taken these things away from me quite easily. My disappearance\u2014and that of my family\u2014would have barely been noticed in the torrents of blood coursing through Rwanda in those months. Our bodies would have joined the thousands in the east-running rivers floating toward Lake Victoria, their skins turning white with water rot.",
      "I wonder today what exactly it was that allowed me to stop the killing clock for four hours.",
      "There were a few things in my favor, but they do not explain everything. I was a Hutu because my father was Hutu, and this gave me a certain amount of protection against immediate execution. But it was not only Tutsis who were slaughtered in the genocide; it was also the thousands of moderate Hutus who were suspected of sympathizing with or even helping the Tutsi \u201ccockroaches.\u201d I was certainly one of these cockroach-lovers. Under the standards of mad extremism at work then I was a prime candidate for a beheading.",
      "Another surface advantage: I had control of a luxury hotel, which was one of the few places during the genocide that had the image of being protected by soldiers. But the important word in that sentence is image. In the opening days of the slaughter, the United Nations had left four unarmed soldiers staying at the hotel as guests. This was a symbolic gesture. I was also able to bargain for the service of five Kigali policemen. But I knew these men were like a wall of tissue paper standing between us and a flash flood.",
      "I remembered all too well what had happened at a place called Official Technical School in a suburb called Kicukiro, where nearly two thousand terrified refugees had gathered because there was a small detachment of United Nations soldiers staying there. The refugees thought\u2014and I don\u2019t blame them\u2014that the blue helmets of the UN would save them from the mobs and their machetes. But after all the foreign nationals at the school were put onto airplanes safely, the Belgians themselves left the country, leaving behind a huge crowd of refugees begging for protection, even begging to be shot in the head so they wouldn\u2019t have to face the machetes. The killing and dismemberment started just minutes later. It would have been better if the soldiers had never been there to offer the illusion of safety. Even the vaguest rumor of rescue had been fatal to those on the wrong side of the racial divide. They had clustered in one spot and made it easy for their executioners to find them. And I knew my hotel could become an abattoir just like that school.",
      "Yet another of my advantages was a very strange one. I knew many of the architects of the genocide and had been friendly with them. It was, in a way, part of my job. I was the general manager of a hotel called the Diplomates, but I was eventually asked to take charge of a sister property, the nearby Hotel Mille Collines, where most of the events described in this book took place. The Mille Collines was the place in Kigali where the power classes of Rwanda came to meet Western businessmen and dignitaries. Before the killing started I had shared drinks with most of these men, served them complimentary plates of lobster, lit their cigarettes. I knew the names of their wives and their children. I had stored up a large bank of favors. I cashed them all in\u2014and then borrowed heavily\u2014 during the genocide. My preexisting friendship with General Augustin Bizimungu in particular helped save the Mille Collines from being raided many times over. But alliances always shift, particularly in the chaos of war, and I knew my supply of liquor and favors would run dry in some crucial quarters. Before the hundred days were over a squad of soldiers was dispatched to kill me. I survived only after a desperate half hour during which I called in even more favors.",
      "All these things helped me during the genocide. But they don\u2019t explain everything.",
      "Let me tell you what I think was the most important thing of all.",
      "I will never forget walking out of my house the first day of the killings. There were people in the streets who I had known for seven years, neighbors of mine who had come over to our place for our regular Sunday cookouts. These people were wearing military uniforms that had been handed out by the militia. They were holding machetes and were trying to get inside the houses of those they knew to be Tutsi, those who had Tutsi relatives, or those who refused to go along with the murders.",
      "There was one man in particular whom I will call Peter, though that is not his real name. He was a truck driver, about thirty years old, with a young wife. The best word I can use to describe him is an American word: cool. Peter was just a cool guy; so nice to children, very gentle, kind of a kidder, but never mean with his humor. I saw him that morning wearing a military uniform and holding a machete dripping in blood. Watching this happen in my own neighborhood was like looking up at a blue summer sky and seeing it suddenly turning to purple. The entire world had gone mad around me.",
      "What had caused this to happen? Very simple: words.",
      "The parents of these people had been told over and over again that they were uglier and stupider than the Tutsis. They were told they would never be as physically attractive or as capable of running the affairs of the country. It was a poisonous stream of rhetoric designed to reinforce the power of the elite. When the Hutus came to power they spoke evil words of their own, fanning the old resentments, exciting the hysterical dark places in the heart.",
      "The words put out by radio station announcers were a major cause of the violence. There were explicit exhortations for ordinary citizens to break into the homes of their neighbors and kill them where they stood. Those commands that weren\u2019t direct were phrased in code language that everybody understood: \u201cCut the tall trees. Clean your neighborhood. Do your duty.\u201d The names and addresses of targets were read over the air. If a person was able to run away his position and direction of travel were broadcast and the crowd followed the chase over the radio like a sports event.",
      "The avalanche of words celebrating racial supremacy and encouraging people to do their duty created an alternate reality in Rwanda for those three months. It was an atmosphere where the insane was made to seem normal and disagreement with the mob was fatal.",
      "Rwanda was a failure on so many levels. It started as a failure of the European colonists who exploited trivial differences for the sake of a divide-and-rule strategy. It was the failure of Africa to get beyond its ethnic divisions and form true coalition governments. It was a failure of Western democracies to step in and avert the catastrophe when abundant evidence was available. It was a failure of the United States for not calling a genocide by its right name. It was the failure of the United Nations to live up to its commitments as a peacemaking body.",
      "All of these come down to a failure of words. And this is what I want to tell you: Words are the most effective weapons of death in man\u2019s arsenal. But they can also be powerful tools of life. They may be the only ones.",
      "Today I am convinced that the only thing that saved those 1,268 people in my hotel was words. Not the liquor, not money, not the UN. Just ordinary words directed against the darkness. They are so important. I used words in many ways during the genocide\u2014to plead, intimidate, coax, cajole, and negotiate. I was slippery and evasive when I needed to be. I acted friendly toward despicable people. I put cartons of champagne into their car trunks. I flattered them shamelessly. I said whatever I thought it would take to keep the people in my hotel from being killed. I had no cause to advance, no ideology to promote beyond that one simple goal. Those words were my connection to a saner world, to life as it ought to be lived.",
      "I am not a politician or a poet. I built my career on words that are plain and ordinary and concerned with everyday details. I am nothing more or less than a hotel manager, trained to negotiate contracts and charged to give shelter to those who need it. My job did not change in the genocide, even though I was thrust into a sea of fire. I only spoke the words that seemed normal and sane to me. I did what I believed to be the ordinary things that an ordinary man would do. I said no to outrageous actions the way I thought that anybody would, and it still mystifies me that so many others could say yes.",
      "ONE",
      "I WAS BORN on the side of a steep hill in the summer of 1954. My father was a farmer, my mother his helper. Our house was made of mud and sticks. We were about a mile away from the nearest village. The first world I can remember was green and bright, full of cooking fires and sisters murmuring and drying sorghum and corn leaves in the wind and the warm arms of my mother.",
      "Our house had three rooms. There were small windows with pieces of hinged wood to keep out the sun and rain. The house was built on an incline of terraced farms, but the small yard outside was flat. My mother kept it swept clean of seedpods and leaves with a homemade broom made out of bundled twigs. When I grew old enough she would let me help her. I still remember the happiness I felt on the day when she trusted me to do it by myself.",
      "From the courtyard you could look south across the winding Ruvayaga Valley to the opposite hill. It seemed an awesome distance, like looking into another country. The hill was laced, as ours was, with houses made out of mud and stucco and baked red tiles, dots of cattle grazing, the groves of avocado plants, and the paddlewide leaves of the banana trees that practically sparkled in the sun. On a perfect day you could lie in the grass near our home and see people at work in the fields on the next hill. They looked like ants. Every now and then somebody\u2019s machete would catch the angle of the sun and you\u2019d see the winking of metal across the valley. And far, far in the distance you could make out the clustered roofs of the village called Gitwe, where my parents told me I would one day learn how to read and write, which neither of them could do.",
      "We spoke the beautiful language of Kinyarwanda, in which I first learned the names of the world\u2019s many things in rich deep vowels made in the back of the mouth. Bird, inyoni. Mud, urwoondo. Stones, amabuye. Milk, amata.",
      "To enter our house through the front door you had to step up on a stoop made of gray rocks. It couldn\u2019t have been more than two feet off the courtyard, but it seemed like a towering height. I used to climb in on my hands and knees. To the side of the door was a flat stone used for sharpening machetes. There was a shallow depression in the middle where rainwater would collect. After a storm I would splash my hands around in the cool water, putting it on my face and letting it dribble down my cheeks. It was the best part of the rain. When those storms came in September the lightning and thunder scared me. My three younger brothers and I would sometimes huddle together during the worst ones. And then we would laugh at each other for our cowardice. Thunder, inkuba.",
      "My parents raised nine children altogether, and I was an island in time\u2019s river, separated by six years from my older sister and five years from my younger brother. I got a lot of attention from my mother as a result, and trailed her around the house hoping she would reward me with a chore. The firmament of our relationship was work; we expressed love to one another in the thousands of little daily actions that kept a rural African family together. She showed me how to take care of the baby goats and cows, and how to grind cassava into flour. Even when I came back to visit my parents when I was grown it would be only minutes before I would find myself holding an empty jerrican and going to fetch well water for my mother.",
      "There was a narrow path from the main road that twisted up the side of the ridge and passed through groves of banana trees. I had learned how to walk on this path. It was our connection with a small village called Nkomero, which occupies the top of one of the hundreds of thousands of hills in Rwanda. The nickname for my country is \u201cthe land of thousands of hills,\u201d or le pays des mille collines, but this signifies a gross undercount. There are at least half a million hills, maybe more. If geography creates culture, then the Rwandan mind is shaped like solid green waves. We are the children of the hills, the grassy slopes, the valley roads, the spider patterns of rivers, and the millions of rivulets and crevasses and buckles of earth that ripple across this part of Central Africa like the lines on the tired face of an elder. If you ironed Rwanda flat, goes the joke, it would be ten times as big. In this country we don\u2019t talk about coming from a particular village, but a particular hill. We had to learn the hard way how to arrange our plots of corn and cabbage into flat terraces on the sloping ground so as not to turn a farm into an avalanche. Every inch of arable land is used this way. The daily walk up to a family grove can be an exercise in calf-straining misery going up, and in thigh-wracking caution going down. I think our legs must be the most muscular on the African continent.",
      "There is a story about the conqueror of Mexico, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, who was asked by the king of Spain to describe the topography of the rugged new nation. Cort\u00e9s reached for the map on the table and crumpled it up into a ball. \u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis what Mexico looks like.\u201d He could just as easily have been talking about Rwanda. If you didn\u2019t grow up here you would be likely to get very, very lost among those seductive hills and valleys.",

      "No ordinary man could recount his life in Rwanda with such eloquence and style as autobiographer Paul Rusesabagina. Mixing fascinating details of the culture and geography of his country, he lays a background for understanding the genocidal massacres that brought his land to inhumane ruins in 1994. Listeners will never believe that narrator Dominic Hoffman isn't the writer. His African-English accent and soft-voiced tones bespeak the intelligent diplomacy by which the author, who was manager of the real-life Hotel Rwanda, was able to save 800 refugees from massacre. The painful anecdotes Hoffman portrays with such equanimity contain lessons of universal value about ethnicity. His facility with the pronunciation of the local names and language adds a dimension of realism and personal involvement rarely encountered in an audiobook. J.A.H.

One late-night jam session on the road unlocked immediate chemistry. Just before the world slipped into quarantine, Bruno called Anderson: \u201cRemember that idea we had back in 2017? Let\u2019s do it.\u201d One studio session grew into to a months-long collaboration, culminating the \u201csetlist of doom.\u201d Legendary Bootsy Collins christened Silk Sonic and came in as the \u201cspecial guest host\u201d for An Evening with Silk Sonic, their debut album. Silk Sonic was finally set free on March 5th, 2021.

Stand out tracks include the radio hits "Wonder" and "Jealousy" which have a similar sonic signature to the unique folk rock mastery of 10,000 Maniacs and "River" an absolutely touching tribute to the late River Phoenix. Mobile Fidelity\'s heralded GAIN 2 mastering technique has extracted every tender nuance and note from this enduring \'90s classic. Track Listing 1. San Andreas Fault 2. Wonder 3. Beloved Wife 4. River 5. Carnival 6. I May Know The Word 7. The Letter 8. Cowboy Romance 9. Jealousy 10. Where I Go 11. Seven Years',

      "Digitally remastered edition of the 1984 debut album from the legendary British quartet. Arriving in an era dominated by Synthpop and gloomy Post-Punk, The Smith's eponymous debut was the beginning of a new era. Johnny Marr's inventive songwriting and ringing guitars were catchy and melodic and were made all the more original by Morrissey's vocal style and lyrics. Although the Smiths continued to improve over the course of their career, the songs here are vital and alive, making sure that their debut remains startling and exciting to this day.  Tracklist:  1. Reel Around the Fountain  2. You\u2019ve Got Everything Now  3. Miserable Lie  4. Pretty Girls Make Graves  5. The Hand That Rocks the Cradle  6. This Charming Man  7. Still Ill  8. Hand in Glove  9. What Difference Does It Make?  10. I Don\u2019t Owe You Anything  11. Suffer Little Children",

      "It will forever remain a mystery why the mighty original Van Halen line-up never released a live recording, especially because they were one of the better live hard rock bands to hit the stage. The first official live Van Halen recording was the 1993 two-CD set, \u201cLive: Right Here, Right Now,\u201d which collected 24 tracks from various tours with singer Sammy Hagar (spanning 1986-92). David Lee Roth-era songs are kept to a bare minimum, and almost the entire \u201cFor Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\u201d featured. Track List: Disc 1 1. Poundcake 2. Judgement Day 3. When It's Love 4. Spanked 5. Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love 6. In 'n' Out 7. Dreams 8. Man on A Mission 9. Ultra Bass 10. Pleasure Dome / Drum Solo Disc 2 1. Right Now 2. There's Only One Way to Rock 3. Why Can't This Be Love 4. Give to Live 5. Finish What Ya Started 6. Best of Both Worlds 7. 316 8. You Really Got Me / Cabo Wabo 9. Won't Get Fooled Again 10. Jump",

      "The bombshell series BRADSHAW ON: THE FAMILY started a revolution in understanding family relationships and how families get messed up and mired in negative behaviors. In this widely acclaimed PBS television series, BRADSHAW ON: THE FAMILY, John Bradshaw focuses on the crisis within the family today, how attitudes become encoded within family members and then acted out on the family and society as a whole. It provides indicators on how to know if your family is healthy, warning signs of unhealthy, destructive, and dysfunctional behaviors and what you can do if your family has been contaminated and is in crisis. This worthwhile and widely acclaimed PBS series contains ten hours of programming focusing on how the dynamics of the family relating to how and why incest, battering, compulsive or addictive behaviors are set up and help with intervention, healing and forgiveness for those in despair and crisis in their relationships. The series provides the revolutionary theory of healthy families and provides coping skills and hope for the family in crisis.

      "The Greatest Trade Ever [Unabridged 6-CD Set]; The Behind-the-Scenes Story of How John Paulson Defied Wall Street and Made Financial History",
    average_rating: 4.6,
    rating_number: 525,
    features: [],
    description: [
      "In 2006, hedge fund manager John Paulson realized something few others suspected--that the housing market and the value of subprime mortgages were grossly inflated and headed for a major fall. Paulson's background was in mergers and acquisitions, however, and he knew little about real estate or how to wager against housing. He had spent a career as an also-ran on Wall Street. But Paulson was convinced this was his chance to make his mark. He just wasn't sure how to do it. Colleagues at investment banks scoffed at him and investors dismissed him. Even pros skeptical about housing shied away from the complicated derivative investments that Paulson was just learning about. But Paulson and a handful of renegade investors such as Jeffrey Greene and Michael Burry began to bet heavily against risky mortgages and precarious financial companies. Timing is everything, though. Initially, Paulson and the others lost tens of millions of dollars as real estate and stocks continued to soar. Rather than back down, however, Paulson redoubled his bets, putting his hedge fund and his reputation on the line. In the summer of 2007, the markets began to implode, bringing Paulson early profits, but also sparking efforts to rescue real estate and derail him. By year's end, though, John Paulson had pulled off the greatest trade in financial history, earning more than $15 billion for his firm--a figure that dwarfed George Soros's billion-dollar currency trade in 1992. Paulson made billions more in 2008 by transforming his gutsy move. Some of the underdog investors who attempted the daring trade also reaped fortunes. But others who got the timing wrong met devastating failure, discovering that being early and right wasn't nearly enough.",

      "One of the most enduring musical partnerships of our time, Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Crosby, Stills & Nash are revered for their peerless vocal harmonies, inspired songwriting and musical virtuosity. When the trio first sang together at a friend's Laurel Canyon house in 1968, their uncanny harmonic convergence was immediately apparent, and CSN took shape. Each member came to the new venture from other high-profile bands-Crosby from the Byrds, Stills from Buffalo Springfield, and Nash from the Hollies-and together, they formed that rarest of musical entities, a \"supergroup\" that lived up to its billing. CSN's 1969 self-titled debut album is one of the true masterpieces of the rock 'n' roll canon, and 1982's Daylight Again is a brilliant portrait of their musical evolution. Still touring and recording together, CSN is an American treasure.  Tracklist:  1. Turn Your Back on Love  2. Wasted on the Way  3. Southern Cross  4. Into the Darkness  5. Delta  6. Since I Met You  7. Too Much Love to Hide  8. Song for Susan  9. You Are Alive  10. Might as Well Have A Good Time  11. Daylight Again  12. Raise A Voice (Bonus Tracks)  13. Feel Your Love (Bonus Tracks)  14. Tomorrow is Another Day (Bonus Tracks)  15. Might as Well Have A Good Time (Original Demo Version)",

      "For Brandon Lake, House of Miracles is much more than an album, it s the prayer of his life. His prayer is that every home in the world would become a house of miracles. Every heart is a hosting place of the Spirit of God, intricately designed to experience miracles. The songs were written to be conduits of hope for every person who listens. Brandon Lake is a songwriter and worship leader with the Bethel Music Collective and a worship pastor at Seacoast Church in South Carolina. Brandon is known for his song This Is A Move, written with Tasha Cobbs - a song that won a 2019 GMA Dove Award for Gospel Worship Recorded Song of the Year, and was also nominated for a 2020 Grammy Award. Brandon Lake s single We Praise You is featured on Bethel Music s Revival In The Air album, co-written with Brian Johnson and Phil Wickham as a bold declaration that the power of praise changes everything.",

      "In true controversial James Frey style, this brilliant new novel is the final Testament of the Holy Bible  .James Frey isn't like other writers. He's been called a liar. A cheat. A con man. He's been called a saviour. A revolutionary. A genius. He's been sued by readers. Dropped by publishers because of his controversies. Berated by TV talk-show hosts and condemned by the media. He's been exiled from America, and driven into hiding. He's also a bestselling phenomenon. Published in 38 languages, and beloved by readers around the world. What scares people about Frey is that he plays with truth; that fine line between fact and fiction. Now he has written his greatest work, his most revolutionary, his most controversial. The Final Testament of the Holy Bible.   What would you do if you discovered the Messiah were alive today? Living in New York. Sleeping with men. Impregnating young women. Euthanizing the dying, and healing the sick. Defying the government, and condemning the holy. What would you do if you met him? And he changed your life. Would you believe? Would you?   The Final Testament of the Holy Bible . It will change you. Hurt you. Scare you. Make you think differently. Live differently. Enrage you. Offend you. Open your eyes to the world in which we live. We've waited 2,000 years for the Messiah to arrive. We've waited 2,000 years for this book to be written. He was here. The Final Testament of the Holy Bible is the story of his life.",

    description: [
      "The Healing Frequency Music Project was created to promote positive, healthy change. Seven unique songs recorded in seven unique frequencies on seven CDs results in 2.5 hours of beautiful, transformational music. Listeners say that WHOLETONES facilitates restorative sleep and brings a tangible sense of peace that permeates their home. Entrepreneurs have reported increased focus and productivity, leading to breakthrough ideas. Artists, musicians, and writers are experiencing heightened levels of creativity and vision. WHOLETONES is ideal music for: prayer rooms, hospice care facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, waiting rooms, offices, family counselors, massage therapists, schools, and more. Seven discs include: Open Door (396Hz), Desert Sojourn (417Hz), The Key of David (444Hz), Transformation (528Hz), The Bridge (639Hz), Great Awakening (741Hz), The Majestic (852Hz). And as an added bonus, I'm also including my brand new book \u2013 Wholetones: The Sound of Healing. It's 142 pages of life-changing personal revelation... a virtual key to unlock your hidden potential. This book is the perfect companion to accompany the music as it demystifies the science behind the frequencies and explains how to get the most out of your listening experience. There is even a chapter that shows musicians how to recalibrate their instruments to play in the 7 healing frequencies. And of course, plenty of historical information concerning the healing tones I believe were given to King David by God Himself! Truly an inspirational journey into the spiritual realm of healing and much, much more... - Michael S. Tyrrell *DISKS & BOOK ONLY - DOES NOT INCLUDE DIGITAL DOWNLOADS!",

      "This 1969 live recording at the Fillmore East was not just a turning point in Mayall's music but also in his career, becoming his first gold album and his most successful release. A heavy lead-guitar sound was abandoned for an intimate setup of acoustic and slide guitars, bass, sax, flute, and percussion. Includes three unissued bonus performances from that night. Track List: 1. The Laws Must Change 2. Saw Mill Gulch Road 3. I'm Gonna Fight for You J.B.  4. So Hard to Share 5. California 6. Thoughts About Roxanne 7. Room to Move Bonus Tracks:  8. Sleeping by Her Side (Bonus Track)  9. Don't Waste My Time (Bonus Track)  10. Can't Sleep This Night (Bonus Track)",

The staple recordings remain, with \u201cHotel California\u201d the most immediately recognizable, as well as hits like \u201cLyin' Eyes\u201d and \u201cNew Kid in Town.\u201d Also included is their single \u201cHole in the World,\u201d written as a response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Like many of The Eagles' songs, the difficult and confrontational subject matter is softened by their trademark vocal harmonies. Track List: Disc 1 1. Take It Easy 2. Witchy Woman 3. Peaceful Easy Feeling 4. Desperado 5. Tequila Sunrise 6. Doolin-Dalton 7. Already Gone 8. The Best of My Love 9. James Dean 10. Ol \u201855 11. Midnight Flyer 12. On the Border 13.

This remaster adds the extended version of Call Me (as featured in the 1980 film American Gigolo), the disco mix of Rapture and the b-side Suzy & Jeffrey! Track List: 1. Europa 2. Live It Up 3.
