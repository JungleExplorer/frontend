Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae Level 2 Nipple, together with the Anti-Colic internal vent system, is clinically proven to reduce colic. Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae bottle and nipple provide a more comfortable feeding experience for baby by decreasing spit-up, burping and gas. This vacuum-free feeding is closest to breastfeeding and Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae Medium Flow Nipples provide a consistent flow so baby can feed at their own pace. The breast-like nipple shape encourages a proper latch for a more natural bottle feeding experience and eases the transition from breast to bottle and back again. The Level 2 Nipple and Anti-Colic vent system is proven to help preserve bottle milk nutrients and aid in digestion for a better night\u2019s sleep. Made of super-soft, 100% silicone, the Level 2 Nipple fits all Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae narrow bottles. The suggested age range for the Level 2 Nipple is 3 months+, but baby\u2019s preferred flow rate may vary. Safe for use in dishwasher (top rack only), electric and microwave sterilizers or boiling water. BPA free."

            "Safely ride rear-facing longer! The Graco Extend2Fit Convertible Car Seat grows with your child from rear-facing harness (4-50 lb) to forward-facing harness (22-65 lb). It features a 4-position extension panel that provides up to 5\u201d of extra rear-facing legroom, allowing your child to safely ride rear-facing longer. Children are safer riding rear-facing and should ride rear-facing as long as possible, until they reach the maximum rear-facing height or weight rating for their car seat. With Extend2Fit, the adjustable extension panel and 50 lb rear-facing weight limit allow the seat to grow with your child in rear-facing mode, providing extended rear-facing use. The seat features the No-Rethread Simply Safe Adjust Harness System, which allows you to adjust the height of the headrest and harness in one motion, and InRight LATCH for a one-second LATCH attachment. Harnessing is made easier with fuss-free harness storage pockets that conveniently hold the harness out of the way while you get baby in and out of the car seat. This car seat is Graco ProtectPlus Engineered to help protect in frontal, side, rear, and rollover crashes. [Recommended Use] : Rear-Facing Harness: 4-50 lb, head must be at least 1\" below handle Forward-Facing Harness: 22-65 lb, up to 49\". STOP using this child restraint and throw it away 10 years after the date of manufacture. Children are safer riding rear-facing and should ride rear-facing as long as possible, until they reach the maximum rear-facing height or weight rating for their car seat. Then children should ride forward-facing, using the built-in harness system for as long as possible until they reach the maximum forward-facing weight or height for their car seat. Be sure to check your local and state laws, as well as AAP and NHTSA recommendations, for car seat usage.* *Graco Supports the American Academy of Pediatrics and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Car Seat Guidelines.

To Use: Place large tube against child's nostril (not inside), creating a seal. Use red mouthpiece to snuck out snot. Tips: (1) Spraying saline solution in each nostril will help loosen thick mucus before using NoseFrida. (2) Move tube in a circular motion against nostril. You will hear and see mucus coming out of nose. (3) Change filter after each use to maintain suction.",

Disposable filters prevent any bacterial transfer. Nosefrida is easy to clean, dishwasher safe, and BPA and Phthalate free.

            "Philips Avent Soothie is the pacifier brand distributed in hospitals nationwide, used by doctors & nurses to soothe newborns. Its one piece construction is specially sized and shaped for babies 0-3 months old and adheres to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. Soothie is designed to calm and soothe without inhibiting normal oral development, like the natural development of teeth and gums. Transparent, tasteless and odorless, the nipple is strong and smooth. It won't become sticky, discolored or misshapen. Soothie is made of hospital-grade, BPA-free and latex-free silicone for strength, comfort and durability. It is dishwasher safe and can be sterilized in a sterilizer. Soon all of our Soothies will say Philips Avent; but for a while, you may see some products that say \u201cSoothie, Children\u2019s Medical Ventures\u201d and others that say \u201cPhilips Avent\u201d in market. Both are real, authentic Philips Avent Soothies. The product meets CPSC safety requirements and the same high quality standards you\u2019ve come to expect from us."

            "Pumping breastmilk is a vital function for new mothers. Keeping the breastmilk safe and ready to store for future use helps to keep your baby healthy. This is why Medela has created these double-zipper and hygienically sealed breastmilk ready to use storage bags. The Medela Breast Milk Storage Bags have been hygienically pre-sealed with durable material and double-zipper protection to prevent leaking. These bags safely store breastmilk in the freezer, fridge, or when traveling. These ready to use breastmilk storage bags are constructed from a durable, double-layer material with a built-in double zipper seal to keep your breastmilk safely stored in the fridge or freezer.",
            "The Medela breastmilk storage bags have been designed to be self-standing and come with a large write-on area. This allows you to document the date and other vital information for safer storage and use. Also, the Medela Breast Milk large 6-ounce Storage Bags have been designed to lay flat for space-saving storage. This unique feature allows quick thawing of frozen milk when your baby is hungry. To help you keep these breastmilk storage bags clean and organized, we\u2019ve added a bonus resealable transport pouch that keeps unused bags organized and clean.",
            "Medela offers two types of storage bags to fit your lifestyle. Our new breast milk storage bags are for moms looking for save only bags and who don't need or want to pump directly into the bag, while our Pump & Save bags are designed for moms who want the added convenience of pumping directly into the bag. With either choice, we've got you covered. Medela\u2019s primary focus is on helping moms to successfully breastfeed their babies for as long as they choose. Meeting this goal responsibly is at the heart of everything we do."

            "The Graco\u00ae SlimFit\u00ae 3-in-1 Car Seat grows with your child, from rear-facing harness (5-40 lb) to forward-facing harness (22-65 lb) to highback booster (40-100 lb). It saves space in your back seat, while giving your child plenty of room to grow. The unique, rotating cup holders simply rotate away, making the seat 10% slimmer to save precious back seat space. The Simply Safe Adjust\u2122 Harness System means you can easily adjust the harness and headrest together, to accommodate your growing child with ease. With 4 recline positions, you can keep your child comfortable, while the InRight\u2122 LATCH system makes installation easy with a one-second attachment. The seat is Graco\u00ae ProtectPlus Engineered\u2122 to help protect your little one in frontal, side, rear, and rollover crashes. Rear-Facing Harness: 5-40 lb, head must be at least 1\" below handle; Forward-Facing Harness: 22-65 lb, up to 49\"; Highback Booster: 40-100 lb, 43-57\", at least 4 years old. STOP using this child restraint and throw it away 10 years after the date of manufacture. Recommended Use] Children are safer riding rear-facing and should ride rear-facing as long as possible, until they reach the maximum rear-facing height or weight rating for their car seat. Then children should ride forward-facing, using the built-in harness system for as long as possible until they reach the maximum forward-facing weight or height for their car seat. At that point, children should ride in a belt-positioning booster seat. A booster is no longer needed once the vehicle seat belt fits properly, typically when they reach 4 feet 9 inches tall and are between ages 8-12. Be sure to check your local and state laws, as well as AAP and NHTSA recommendations, for car seat usage.* *Graco Supports the American Academy of Pediatrics and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Car Seat Guidelines. Visit our safety page for information on car seat usage recommendations."

The anti-colic internal vent system is clinically proven to reduce colic. Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae bottles provide a more comfortable feeding experience for baby by decreasing spit-up, burping and gas. This vacuum-free feeding is closest to breastfeeding and Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae silicone nipples provide a consistent flow so baby can feed at their own pace. The breast-like nipple shape encourages a proper latch for a more natural bottle feeding experience and eases the transition from breast to bottle and back again. Dr. Brown\u2019s vent system is proven to help preserve bottle milk nutrients and aids in digestion for a better night\u2019s sleep. The silicone nipple, together with the internal vent system, offer a reliable and trusted bottle feeding experience that makes Dr. Brown\u2019s the #1 Pediatrician Recommended Baby Bottle in the U.S.* Made to grow with baby, our bottle is designed to nourish through all of baby\u2019s feeding stages and is recyclable.

After all, isn't the baby bottle one of the first objects that your baby experiences through all five senses?

In our voyage, we've learned an important lesson. Inspiring products are born only when we think with a mother's heart & experience through a baby's eyes. We proudly introduce Comotomo Natural-Feel Baby BottleTM. Comotomo Baby Bottles feature innovative and sensible design to most closely mimic natural breastfeeding.

            "The Graco Affix highback Booster Seat with Latch System helps safely transport your big kid from 40 to 100 lb and up to 57\" tall. It provides a secure connection to your vehicle seat with its one-hand front-adjust Latch system, making self-buckling easier for your independent child. While the purpose of the Latch in the Affix Booster is to secure the booster to the vehicle seat while the booster is unoccupied and help facilitate independent buckling, you will secure your child in the booster seat with the vehicle lap/shoulder belt. The seat has an integrated cup holder and hideaway storage compartment to keep child's drinks and favorite things within arm's reach. This seat is Graco Protect Plus Engineered to help protect your child in frontal, rear & rollover crashes. To continue to meet industry standards, we have increased the weight minimum from 30 to 40 lb Since the Latch system only secures the booster seat to the vehicle in this application and is not used for installation, it may be used regardless of the weight of the child (up to the maximum weight recommendation of the seat). Care and Maintenance: Machine-washable seat cushion. Metal and plastic parts may be cleaned with mild soap and cool water."

            "Product Description",
            "Do ice cold wipes trigger unhappy cries during diaper changes? The Warm Glow Wipe Warmer by Munchkin will soothe baby's bottom and warm mom's heart. Help make diaper changing more enjoyable for your little one with the comfort of a warm wipe. This convenient wipe warming system stores up to 100 standard baby wipes and dispenses them conveniently from a flip top lid. Its low voltage, top down warming system ensures a warm wipe every time without the risk of browning, drying, or discoloration. It also features a soft glow night light that helps with nighttime changes and automatically shuts off after 10 minutes of use. A built in window allows you to keep tabs on your wipes supply without opening the unit, while the tightly sealing system keeps wipes moist over time. \u2022 The power adapter is compatible with and should be plugged into a standard household 110 120 volt AC outlet only. Do not plug into a 220 volt or alternative voltage AC outlet. Only use with a Class 2 adapter.  Usage : Place Warm Glow Wipe Warmer on a flat, stable and suitable surface. Slide locks (located on each side of the warmer) forward, and lift the main lid. Remove \u201cPop-Up\u201d wipes or \u201cOriginal/Standard\u201d wipes from their original package, and insert into warmer. If \u201cPop-Up\u201d wipes are used, push top wipe up through the opening under the smaller lid. Close both lids, and slide locks back into locked position. Be sure smaller lid is also closed securely. Do not over-fill with wipes. Both lids should be able to completely close. To access a \u201cPop-Up\u201d wipe, open smaller lid and pull. To access an \u201cOriginal/ Standard\u201d wipe, unlock and open main lid. Be sure to slide locks back into place when finished. (Please note, the use of \u201cPop-Up\u201d wipes is preferred. To use \u201cOriginal/Standard\u201d wipes, you must open the main lid each time a wipe is needed, which may contribute to the drying of wipe). Because of the continuous low levels of heat and moisture associated with the warmer, unit must be placed on a compatible surface (wood and painted surfaces are not recommended).",

To Use: Place large tube against child's nostril (not inside), creating a seal. Use red mouthpiece to snuck out snot. Tips: (1) Spraying saline solution in each nostril will help loosen thick mucus before using NoseFrida. (2) Move tube in a circular motion against nostril. You will hear and see mucus coming out of nose. (3) Change filter after each use to maintain suction.Brand StoryFROM DELIVERY TO BOOGERS, BUTTS AND BEYOND! Frida is the brand that gets parents. That means you. We are not a lifestyle. Far from it. We are a solution-based brand. The 411 of parenting. The who-do-I-call-in-the-middle-of-the-night-cause-my-baby-won't-stop-screaming brand.",

Ingeniously simple Swedish design features a tube that is placed against the nostril (not inside). Parents use their own suction to draw mucus out of their child's nose. Disposable filters prevent any bacterial transfer. Nosefrida is easy to clean, dishwasher safe, and BPA and Phthalate free. It is superior to the bulb aspirator, presents no risk or harm to internal nasal structures and is dramatically more efficacious.",

            "Graco's top-rated Backless TurboBooster Car Seat helps keep your big kid safe in the car. This backless booster seat is built for comfort with a padded seat and height-adjustable armrests. It's a terrific option to help protect older children and kids who are ready to transition out of a harness booster, but not yet ready to ride with just your vehicle's seat belt. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, school-aged children should ride in a belt-positioning booster seat until at least age 8 or until the seat belt fits correctly. The Backless TurboBooster car seat is designed to protect children ages 4 to 10 who are between 40 and 100 lbs and 43 to 57 inches tall. Dual, hideaway cup holders are just right for holding your child's cups or water bottles, so that they've got just what they need for a comfortable ride in the car with you. After all, a comfortable passenger is a happy passenger. When you're ready to clean your deluxe, padded seat cushion, simply remove it and wash it in your washing machine with gentle detergent. Then, all plastic parts of the seat may be cleaned with mild soap and water. The Backless TurboBooster seat has been engineered and rigorously crash tested to meet or exceed all applicable US standards. Product information/Technical Details Chart: Minimum height recommendation: 43 inches Maximum height recommendation: 57 inches."

            "There are times when breastfeeding can be a challenge. For women who experience problems with breastfeeding, using a high-quality contact nipple shield in conjunction with medical assistance can often resolve these problems. Medela\u2019s Contact Nipple Shield is designed to address common breastfeeding issues such as latch-on difficulties, soreness, and flat or inverted nipples. Made of 100% ultra-thin and soft silicone, these contact nipple shields feature a unique design with a cut-out area that encourages maximized skin contact between you and your baby. This not only helps your baby receive the breastmilk they need for development, it also promotes the mother-baby bond.",
            "We take pride in manufacturing our contact nipple shields with 100% pure silicone and all other breast pump products that come into contact with breastmilk with non-BPA plastic materials. This ensures that the integrity of your breastmilk is maintained along with its powerful nutrients and benefits. For added convenience, we\u2019ve included (2) contact nipple shields and a portable carrying case for traveling or when you\u2019re heading out on errands around town. It\u2019s always best to keep a spare contact nipple shield safely protected.",
            "We strongly recommend using our contact nipple shields under the direction and guidance of a physician, lactation consultant, or other healthcare professional to ensure proper use and address any underlying breastfeeding challenges or issues. Medela\u2019s primary focus is on helping moms to successfully breastfeed their babies for as long as they choose. Meeting this goal responsibly is at the heart of everything we do."

Lansinoh TheraPearl 3-in-1 Breast Therapy Packs provide hot or cold pain relief again and again for tender, overworked breasts. Simply pop them in the microwave or freezer \u2013 no boiling required. Use hot therapy to relieve clogged ducts and mastitis. Heat one pack at a time using the enclosed directions. Once warm, place in the soft cover and apply to your breast.

To use as a breast pump aid, heat according to the instructions and wrap around the breast pump flange. Do not overheat. Please follow heating instructions printed on the pads and in the packaging insert. Always test pack temperature prior to use. Breast therapy should be applied for 20 minutes, or as recommended by a doctor. Do not heat the soft covers.

            "Nuby\u2019s No-Spill cup with Flex Straw is great for travel and on-the-go sipping. Nuby has designed the No-Spill cup with a soft silicone straw that is gentle on children\u2019s teeth and gums. The straw features our pressure-sensitive TOUCH-FLO valve to help prevent drips and spills. The TOUCH-FLO valve regulates fluid intake as children drink from the straw, opening only with the pressure from their mouth. When not sipping from the straw, the valve closes, ensuring a leak-resistant cup. The No-Spill Cup with Flex Straw has an Easy Grip base contoured especially for little hands."

Sure, a warm wipe feels better than a cold one, but if you don't believe us, perhaps you will when your baby winces when you use a cold wipe on her bottom, or when your toddler is able to say, \"\"Brrr, that's cold.\"\" After all, we adults use warm water to wet shave or to wash our faces without even thinking about it. Yes, warm water feels better than cold, but we also know that using warm water allows pores to remain open, resulting in a closer shave or more effective (and comfortable) face wash. Cold water simply causes pores to shut, simple as that. Why go cold on a baby's bottom? It just doesn't make sense from a comfort or hygiene perspective. Dirty diapers are warm environments and the pores are open. When you wipe with a cold wipe, it causes pores to close and traps the bacteria rather than allowing them to remain open for a more hygienic clean. We want the cleanest clean for Baby's bottom - no diaper rash - and want a diaper change to feel good, especially during the 3am changes. EVERYBODY loves a warm wipe. The Ultimate Wipes Warmer has a classic look and has been a reliable work horse, warming baby wipes to the perfect temperature for nearly 25 years. Bottoms up!",

            "The world continues to change right before our eyes. But why is it that baby bottles are the same old unflattering tools? After all, isn't the baby bottle one of the first objects that your baby experiences through all five senses? Why should mothers have to worry about toxic plastic & colic-inducing design for something so basic & important? We found no good reason & decided to challenge the status quo. In our voyage, we've learned an important lesson. Inspiring products are born only when we think with a mother's heart & experience through a baby's eyes. We proudly introduce ComotomoTM Replacement Nipples. Comotomo Nipple Packs are replacements specifically designed for Comotomo Baby Bottles. Each pack comes with 2 silicone nipples designed to most closely mimic natural breastfeeding. Our naturally shaped, soft, silicone nipples are ideal for babies who have trouble transitioning from nursing to bottle feeding. Each replacement nipple also has two truly innovative vents that are built in to prevent colic, while totally eliminating leaking issues. ComotomoTM Replacement Nipples grow with your baby, and are available separately in 4 stages: truly Slow Flow (1 Hole) for ages birth-3 months, Medium Flow (2 Hole) for ages 3-6 months, Fast Flow (3 Hole) for ages 6+ months, and Variable Flow (Y-Cut) for ages 6+ months (thicker fluids). Easy Feedings, Happy Baby: - Naturally shaped, soft, silicone nipples - ideal for breastfed babies - Designed to eliminate nipple confusion issues - Dual anti-colic vents prevent unwanted air intake and reduce colic - ComotomoTM replacement Nipples grow with your baby Easy to Clean: - Safe in microwave, boiling water, dishwashers and sterilizers Safe Feeding: - Made of 100% safe, hygienic silicone Safety:Keep all components not in use out of reach of children. Over time, milk residues can get trapped in the vent and prevent it from working properly. The best thing to do is to make sure that the ends of the vents (back of the nipple) are clear and free from any blockage. You can easily clean them by kneading the vent tips in warm water. Also, you can sterilize the nipple in boiling water for 5 minutes to clear out anything that may be clogging in the vent.",

The Simple Serve is easy to use: simply add the desired amount of water to the vial, pour it in, add your bottle and push the button. It really is that simple! When the warming light turns off, the machine automatically shuts off and your bottle is ready. This warmer for baby bottles is fantastic for a wide range of baby bottle styles including standard narrow and wide-necked bottles and even angled bottles. Use the included basket to sanitize up to two baby pacifiers at a time. When you're done, the baby water vial, basket, adapter ring, and baby sanitizer lid are all top-rack dishwasher safe for a no-hassle cleaning.",

            "Soft, cuddly and so lovable, the Philips Avent Soothie snuggle SCF347/03 is the perfect first friend for baby. It makes Soothie, the pacifier used by doctors and nurses to calm newborns in hospitals nationwide, easy for parents and babies to find. It also keeps Soothie close to baby. The Soothie and stuffed animal detach and can easily be cleaned separately. Just sterilize the Soothie in boiling water or a sterilizing bag and toss the stuffed animal in the washing machine. Then leave it out to air dry. The stuffed animal has a second attachment mechanism for pacifiers with ring handles. Soothie snuggle is BPA free. Soon all of our Soothies will say Philips Avent; but for a while, you may see some products that say \u201cSoothie, Children\u2019s Medical Ventures\u201d and others that say \u201cPhilips Avent\u201d in market. Both are real, authentic Philips Avent Soothies. The product meets CPSC safety requirements and the same high quality standards you\u2019ve come to expect from us."

            "The instinctive action of sucking helps to calm and soothe babies and all parents know there\u2019s nothing more wonderful than a calm, content baby. Little mouths don\u2019t always hold onto heavy baby pacifiers which means parents often need to replace the pacifier in their baby\u2019s mouth every few minutes. Our Ultra-Light Silicone pacifier is our lightest ever pacifier and is light enough to stay put in baby\u2019s mouth for longer helping babies to stay calmer, soothed and happier for longer. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no \u2018wrong\u2019 side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your baby\u2019s mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The curved shield sits comfortably between baby\u2019s chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby\u2019s delicate skin against irritation. The smooth surface of silicone is very easy to clean and won\u2019t absorb stains and odors. The hygienic, anti-static properties prevent dust from settling and as it has a one-piece design, it is really easy to clean - simply pop in a sterilizer, wash by hand or in the top shelf of the dishwasher. We recommend that you replace the pacifier every month and always at the first signs of damage or weakness. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months *From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 moms with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee\u00ae pacifier: \u2022 *99% of moms would recommend a Tommee Tippee pacifier \u2022 *97% of moms say a Tommee Tippee pacifier helped settle baby \u2022 *93% of moms say babies love their Tommee Tippee pacifier \u2022 97.5% of babies accept a Tommee Tippee pacifier Warning! Do not tie pacifier around child\u2019s neck as it presents a strangulation danger."

            "The VTech DM221 Digital Audio Monitor with DECT 6.0 digital technology provides crystal clear transmission, eliminating the annoying white noise you hear from analog monitors. The only sounds you hear are coming from your baby. Totally digital transmission eliminates background noise and prevents interference so you can rest assured the only sounds you\u2014and only you\u2014will hear are your baby's. Make sure the Baby Unit is turned on. Move the Parent Unit closer to the Baby Unit, but not closer than 1 meter / 3 feet. If you are using the Parent Unit in cordless mode, the battery may be low and requires recharging. A full charge takes 12 hours. Reset the system by disconnecting power from both units, waiting at least one minute, then reconnecting power. Allow time for the two units to link to each other. Nearby cordless phones or other electronic devices may be interfering with the baby monitor. Separate these devices as far apart as possible. When you turn the nightlight on, if no sound is detected for 15 minutes, the light will turn itself off.",

This 6 pack of water-resistant changing pad liners gives you extra protection, allowing you to be a true quick-change artist. The liners measure 22.75\" x 11.5\" and feature PVC-free waterproof backing to protect standard changing pads and bassinets from messes and leaks. They're also machine-washable, eliminating the need to replace diaper pad covers in their entirety - simply replace the soiled liner and get on with your day. Because while it's great to have backup diaper pad covers on hand, it's even better not to deal with the hassle of switching them out multiple times a day."

The spinning wheel encourages baby to reach, tug and bat, strengthening hand-eye coordination. Each feature on the wheel spins individually when baby bats at it, introducing baby to cause & effect. The colorful beads trapped within the clear structures allow baby to connect the sound to sight. The toy's handle is multi-textured, perfect for mouthing. This 2-in-1 toy can be suctioned to a table or high chair tray, or removed from the base for floor play."

            "Munchkin knows when it comes to bath time, safety comes first. But cuteness is a definite close second. That's why Munchkin created the non-slip bath mat called Dandy Dots. The candy-colored, textured surface keeps your little one from slipping or sliding, while the skid-resistant suction cups keep the mat securely in place. Plus, it's as cute as a button just like your little one. By Munchkin.",

            "Dr. Brown\u2019s Natural Flow\u00ae Level 4 Nipple is the fastest flow for babies 9 months+. Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae Level 4 Nipple, together with the Anti-Colic internal vent system, is clinically proven to reduce colic. Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae bottle and nipple provide a more comfortable feeding experience for baby by decreasing spit-up, burping and gas. This vacuum-free feeding is closest to breastfeeding and Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae Fast Flow Nipples provide a consistent flow so baby can feed at their own pace. The breast-like nipple shape encourages a proper latch for a more natural bottle feeding experience and eases the transition from breast to bottle and back again. The Level 4 Nipple and Anti-Colic vent system is proven to help preserve bottle milk nutrients and aid in digestion for a better night\u2019s sleep. Made of super-soft, 100% silicone, the Level 4 Nipple fits all Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae Options+\u2122 wide-neck bottles. The suggested age range for the Level 4 Nipple is 9 months+, but baby\u2019s preferred flow rate may vary. Safe for use in dishwasher (top rack only), electric and microwave sterilizers or boiling water. BPA free."

            "Your options have never been better with Dr. Brown\u2019s Natural Flow\u00ae Anti-Colic Options+\u2122 First Year Feeding Set. The anti-colic internal vent system is clinically proven to reduce colic. Dr. Brown\u2019s bottles provide a more comfortable feeding experience for baby by decreasing spit-up, burping and gas. This vacuum-free feeding is closest to breastfeeding and Dr. Brown\u2019s silicone nipples provide a consistent flow so baby can feed at their own pace. The breast-like nipple shape encourages a proper latch for a more natural bottle feeding experience and eases the transition from breast to bottle and back again. Dr. Brown\u2019s vent system is proven to help preserve bottle milk nutrients and aids in digestion for a better night\u2019s sleep. The silicone nipple, together with the internal vent system, offer a reliable and trusted bottle feeding experience that makes Dr. Brown\u2019s the #1 Pediatrician Recommended Baby Bottle in the U.S.* Made to grow with baby, our bottle is designed to nourish through all of baby\u2019s feeding stages and is recyclable. Safe for use in dishwasher (top rack only), electric and microwave sterilizers or boiling water. BPA Free."

            "Make bath time fun and safe with the Mommy's Helper Froggie Collection Inflatable Bath tub for babies and toddlers. 100% phthalate free materials provide a durable, safe, and padded space to bathe your baby. Great as an infant travel tub and on the go. Simply inflate and deflate as needed. Folds compact enough to take anywhere, even fits in diaper bag! Attached saddle horn turns this inflatable bathtub into an inflatable baby bath Seat. Saddle horn keeps baby from sliding down into tub while sit bathing offering additional support. Inflation is optional so that when your little one begins to grow and shows independence you may choose not to deflate saddle horn so that your child has more room TO play and splash around. Easy to clean, simply wipe down with a wet cloth and mild soap. Rinse with warm water and allow to air dry. Bathtub measures 19.5\" In length, 10\" In width, and 7.5\" In height. The recommended age for this product is 6 to 24 months.",

            "Finally, a pacifier that soothes babies and parents too! The PhysioForma Soft Silicone Orthodontic Pacifier is a 100% silicone one-piece pacifier that isn't just for pacifying, but is also clinically developed for comfort, breathing and orthodontic benefits.An exclusive nipple design helps position baby\u2019s tongue forward to maintain an open airway, which supports physiological breathing. Physiological breathing is especially important during sleep. It improves quality of sleep and reduces irritability - better for baby & you!The unique angle and lateral curve of the nipple evenly distribute tongue pressure across baby's palate. Tiny ridges and an inclined nipple shape guide proper tongue placement. Together, these important features support baby's growing palate and teeth.For baby\u2019s comfort, the nipple is made from extra-soft silicone with a satin-textured finish to help keep the paci in baby\u2019s mouth for uninterrupted soothing. Multiple ventilation holes promote air circulation and help reduce moisture buildup on baby\u2019s soft, sensitive skin. Plus, there's an easy-to-grab handle for either baby or parent to hold.The PhysioForma exclusive nipple design was developed, tested, and approved in partnership with an advisory panel of leading neonatologists, pediatricians, and orthodontists. The one-piece Soft Silicone pacifiers also adhere to the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics and are accepted by 9 out of 10 babies.Available in three sizes: 0-6m, 6-16m, and 16-24m. Reusable, sterilizing/carry case included."

            "The Philips AVENT My Bendy Straw Cup 10 Oz is the ideal choice for the growing, active toddler. This dentist recommended cup was developed alongside experts in order to make it our best straw cup possible and one that allows for healthy oral development. The cup's contoured shape and anti-slip texture grips make it easy for little hands to hold the cup. The 10 Oz cup is the perfect size to keep your child hydrated throughout the day and through active times. With this straw cup, your child will be able to drink 'til the very last drop thanks to the Philips Avent unique bent-straw- the lower part of the straw is elongated and bends forward ensuring the straw easily reaches the cup's contents and allows the development of a natural drinking position. The cup has an integrated anti-leak valve to prevent spills (even when the cup is open!) and the flip-top protects the straw and prevents leakage while on-the-go. Our advanced technology ensures that the cup is leak-proof all of the time, and comes with a 100% Leak-proof Money Back Guarantee in the case it should not deliver on this promise. For your convenience, this product is BPA-Free, dishwasher safe and compatible with Philips AVENT Natural and Anti-Colic bottles & all other sippy cups. Mix and match our bottle and cup parts, and create the product that works for you, when you need it. 90% of 200 U.S. pediatric dentists agree that the design of the Philips Avent straw cup allows healthy oral development. 86% of those dentists would recommend this Philips AVENT straw cup."

            "Forget huge, loud and complicated automatic pumps which cost hundreds and need to be pulled to pieces and cleaned thoroughly every time you use them. This 100% food grade and simple to use breast pump will change your life - truly. Fits perfectly into any handbag or baby bag and requires no hard work. Also the best travel pump you will find! This compact pump is perfect for long distance trips, planes, car rides, family BBQ's or anywhere you would like to discretely express, quickly. Simply suction to your breast and let the pump do the work for you as it draws your milk using suction. 100% safe for mum, baby and our environment. How to use your breast pump: Sterilise your pump (caps are available online to purchase - caps keep the pump sterile after cleaning) Place top of pump over your nipple - make sure your nipple is n the neck of the pump and comfortable. Apply suction - you may need to adjust a couple of times. Once the pump is secure and comfortable you can squeeze the base of the pump (not interfering with the top/suction) to create some movement. A warm flannel on top of your breast is also a great tip and gently massage the top of your breast. Once milk begins to flow simply leave the pump alone to do its thing. Once the pump becomes full empty into a glass storage bottle and reposition. Also attach in the same way while your child is feeding on your other breast and collect all let down and milk which would other wise be lost into a breast pad. Waking up in the middle of the night or if engorged during the day also attach your pump for relief. Clean after each use. No bleach based agents"

            "Having a difficult time finding the right pacifier for your baby? The NUK value pack provides 3 different pacifiers in one package. Like all NUK pacifiers, the value pack features the improved NUK orthodontic nipple shape. Invented over 60 years ago by pediatric dentists and doctors, the NUK pacifier is modeled after the natural shape of mom\u2019s nipple while breastfeeding. This makes for an easy transition from breast to pacifier and back. The asymmetrical nipple naturally fits baby\u2019s palate and is now improved to allow for more room for a natural sucking motion, reduce pressure on teeth and jaw, and helps prevent teeth misalignment. The NUK heart-shaped shield fits perfectly under baby\u2019s nose for easier breathing and prevents irritation. With a convenient glow-in-the-dark feature to help you find lost a pacifier during the night, this pack of 3 orthodontic pacifiers is ideal for your child aged 0-6 months. (Based on Market Research, 2017, tested with 307 pacifier users)."

            "The Baby K'tan Baby Carrier is an innovative soft cotton baby carrier that is an ideal blend of a sling, wrap and carrier, providing the positions and benefits of all three. There is no other carrier available like it that enables parents and caregivers to comfortably carry infants and toddlers from birth to 3 years in multiple positions. The K'tan carrier is ideal for premature babies and babies with special needs. It is lightweight and compact like a sling, yet goes over both shoulders to evenly distribute baby's weight like a structured carrier. The adjustable back support band offers the wearer extra back support and makes it easy to adjust baby or toddler's weight distribution on both shoulders. The exclusive design offers the wearer a 100% cotton carrier that is ready-to-wear, with no buckles, snaps, rings or hardware. Extremely simple to use, the secret behind this parent-invented, ready-to-wear baby carrier is its unique double-loop design, which gives added security for carrying baby and privacy for mom while nursing. It is easy to put on and take off, and comes in a free carry bag. Baby K'tan uses all 100% natural cotton, free of harmful chemicals, formaldehydes and Azo dyes."

To Use: Place large tube agaist child's nostril (not inside), creating a seal. Use red mouthpiece to snuck out snot. Tips: (1) Spraying saline solution in each nostril will help loosen thick mucus before using NoseFrida. (2) Move tube in a circular motion against nostril. You will hear and see mucus coming out of nose. (3) Change filter after each use to maintain suction.",

            "The 23\" tall Position and Lock Tall gate that fits openings from 26-42\" helps parents keep their children safe from common household dangers. Not only is this classic pressure mount gate easy to install as there is no hardware required, it also helps prevent damage to your home due to the robust non-marring rubber bumpers. Also, the locking bar is marked and notched for easy installation and re-installation. If a little extra height is what you're looking for, this gate is a great choice as kids will have a hard time surmounting this obstacle. It also is wonderful to use with pets and dogs that can jump over smaller gates. Finally, the sturdy wood frame and vinyl-coated mesh are durable and secure leaving you with a feeling of assurance that your child is away from harm. CHILD Age: 6-24 mos."

            "Philips Avent SCF190/03 Soothie Pacifier helps calm and soothe newborns. Designed for babies from birth to 3 months old, the Soothie Pacifier is made of hospital-grade, BPA-free and latex-free silicone for strength, comfort and durability. Its one piece construction is specially sized and shaped for a newborn's mouth and adheres to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. Distributed in hospitals nationwide, this pacifier is uniquely shaped to comfortably fit newborn mouths to calm and soothe without inhibiting normal oral development. Transparent, tasteless and odorless, the nipple is strong and smooth and resists becoming sticky. Even after extended use, it won't become discolored or misshapen. The Soothie Pacifier can be sterilized using a Philips Avent sterilizer and is dishwasher safe. Soon all of our Soothies will say Philips Avent; but for a while, you may see some products that say \u201cSoothie, Children\u2019s Medical Ventures\u201d and others that say \u201cPhilips Avent\u201d in market. Both are real, authentic Philips Avent Soothies. The product meets CPSC safety requirements and the same high quality standards you\u2019ve come to expect from us."

Designed especially for wide mouth bottles and nipples, the Munchkin High Capacity Dishwasher Basket gives you the day off from bottle washing duty! With its jumbo size, you can fit all of your little one's baby items and bottle parts into the basket and run them through the dishwasher without worrying that you'll lose track of them once the wash cycle ends. This handy dishwasher caddy features a patented straw cleaning rack on the side to hold straws upright and firmly in place for a thorough clean. Flip the lid open and place pacifiers, spoons, bottle sealing discs, valves, caps and other small parts into the basket. Easily press nipples into the nipple sanitizing lid, snap into place, and you are set to wash without worry!

            "Philips Avent Natural Response nipple lets baby control the pace of the milk, like they do when breastfeeding. The nipples' unique opening and tip only releases milk when your baby actively drinks. When pausing to swallow and breathe no milk flows. Baby can drink, swallow, and breathe using their natural rhythm, just like they do when breastfeeding. Easily combine breast and bottle feeding with a wide breast-shaped nipple with a soft feel that mimics the shape and feel of a breast; plus baby controlling the flow of milk. The nipple has a no-drip design which helps prevent lost milk from the tip. An anti-colic valve integrated into the nipple is designed to reduce colic and discomfort by sending air away from your baby's tummy. The Natural response nipples come in flow rates 1-5, to keep up with your baby's growth. Use Philips Avent Natural bottles only with Philips Avent Natural nipples. Includes: 4 Natural Response nipples, flow 2. SCY962/04 What to expect when introducing the Philips Avent Natural Response Nipple It is totally natural for your baby to take 2-3 tries to get milk flowing from a new bottle. Unlike traditional bottles the Natural bottle is designed to only release milk when your baby is actively drinking, like what happens when babies breastfeed. We have 5 different nipple flow rates for the Natural bottle. When looking for the right nipple flow rate, age is a guide, but your baby's approach to drinking and the feeding cues they will show will help determine when to move to a higher or lower nipple flow rate."

Plus, they feature our Dual Leak-Guard Barriers that gently seal around your baby's legs, where leaks happen most.\u200b\u200b\u200b And forget fiddling with ordinary diaper tapes! Pampers Cruisers 360 has a 360-degree stretchy waistband designed to quickly and easily pull up onto your wiggly baby. And when a diaper change is complete, we\u2019ve made disposal simple. All you need to do is RIP the Easy-Tear Sides and ROLL the diaper, then secure it with the disposal tape that comes attached to the back. Simple as that.\u200b\u200b\u200b Also, to keep your baby's delicate skin healthy, Pampers Cruisers 360 delivers breathable dryness, pulling out wetness and locking it away from skin using our exclusive LockAway Channels.

To Use: Place large tube agaist child's nostril (not inside), creating a seal. Use red mouthpiece to snuck out snot. Tips: (1) Spraying saline solution in each nostril will help loosen thick mucus before using NoseFrida. (2) Move tube in a circular motion against nostril. You will hear and see mucus coming out of nose. (3) Change filter after each use to maintain suction.",

The wide openings on these trainer cups for babies allow for easy filling and cleaning, while the non-slip handles make it easy for babies to hold by themselves. All MAM bottle nipples are compatible with the Trainer Cup to suit baby\u2019s individual needs at any developmental stage. Parenting is hard. We make stuff to make it easier. MAM knows that being a parent is not always easy. That's why we make products that are smart and simple to use. For over 40 years we've been obsessed with making innovative pacifiers, bottles, cups, teethers, and toothbrushes. All to provide parents with solutions and babies with optimal care at all stages."

To Use: Place large tube against child's nostril (not inside), creating a seal. Use red mouthpiece to snuck out snot. Tips: (1) Spraying saline solution in each nostril will help loosen thick mucus before using NoseFrida. (2) Move tube in a circular motion against nostril. You will hear and see mucus coming out of nose. (3) Change filter after each use to maintain suction.",

It's much more than just a clock \u2013 it's a whole sleep system. Starting with bedtime, the parent reads the specially written 'Sleepy Farm' book (included) and explains that the child should look at the clock to see all the stars in the sky around the moon. A perfect night's sleep If the child wakes in the night, they simply glance at the clock to know what to do: if there are stars showing, they should lie down and relax as it's not time to get up yet, and the stars will keep them company. As the stars count down, they know it is almost time, and then with a big smile the sun arrives on the screen to signal that it is time to go and see mum and dad. Features and benefits of the Gro-Clock Two wake-up times Two wake-up times The Gro-Clock has two wake-up times so you can set one for the morning and one for afternoon naps.

            "Our most earth conscious diapers yet feature a wetness indicator, better absorption & blowout protection, cloud-like comfort and unique features for each babe stage \u2013 all while using less material and helping save over 7000 trees every single year. Plus, a secure, comfy fit for less sag + more swag. What Makes A Clean Conscious Diaper? To make the core of the diaper, we harvest wood from sustainably managed pine + spruce trees in Scandinavia, which is then turned into fluff pulp at a Swedish mill using totally chlorine-free processing \u2013 aka no dioxins (toxic chemicals) in our waterway. We don't add latex, fragrance, or parabens. We use a 100% plant-based backsheet, and our new, more efficient design reduces the amount of material used in each diaper. Our diapers are cruelty-free and never tested on animals. Our diaper boxes are made from 100% PCR post recycled consumer cardboard (aka they\u2019re 100% recyclable) \u2013 that means no new trees cut down and no landfill, if recycled."

            "Philips Avent Natural bottle with the Natural Response nipple lets baby control the pace of the milk, like they do when breastfeeding. The nipples' unique opening and tip only releases milk when your baby actively drinks. When pausing to swallow and breathe no milk flows. Baby can drink, swallow, and breathe using their natural rhythm, just like they do when breastfeeding. Easily combine breast and bottle feeding with a wide breast-shaped nipple with a soft feel that mimics the shape and feel of a breast; plus baby controlling the flow of milk like they do when breastfeeding. The nipple has a no-drip design which helps prevent lost milk from the tip. An anti-colic valve integrated into the nipple is designed to reduce colic and discomfort by sending air away from your baby's tummy. The ergonomic shape makes it comfortable for parents to hold and easy for small fingers to grasp. Assembly is simple with only a few parts and the wide bottle neck makes filling and cleaning easy. The Natural bottle is made from polypropylene, a BPA free material, and works with all nipples and caps from the Natural line. The Natural response nipples come in flow rates 1-5, to keep up with your baby's growth. Includes: 4 11oz Natural bottles with Natural Response nipples, flow 4. SCY906/04 What to expect when introducing the Philips Avent Natural Response Nipple It is totally natural for your baby to take 2-3 tries to get milk flowing from a new bottle. Unlike traditional bottles the Natural bottle is designed to only release milk when your baby is actively drinking, like what happens when babies breastfeed. We have 5 different nipple flow rates for the Natural bottle. When looking for the right nipple flow rate, age is a guide, but your baby's approach to drinking and the feeding cues they will show will help determine when to move to a higher or lower nipple flow rate."

            "The instinctive action of sucking helps to calm and soothe babies and all parents know there\u2019s nothing more wonderful than a calm, content baby. When mom\u2019s breast isn\u2019t available, our Breast-like pacifier is the next best thing for baby to latch onto in between feeds. Made from super soft silicone, this pacifier feels, moves, flexes and stretches just like skin so there\u2019s less chance of confusion when feeding baby from breast or bottle. The natural feel and flex of this breast-like pacifier, inspired by our award-winning Closer to Nature\u00ae nipple, provides a reassuring alternative to traditional pacifiers. Perfect if you\u2019re worried that offering your baby a pacifier may disrupt breast or bottle feeding. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no \u2018wrong\u2019 side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your baby\u2019s mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The breast-like pacifier shield curves away from baby\u2019s face and offers superior ventilation and extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby\u2019s delicate skin against irritation. BPA-free and easy to clean - simply pop in a sterilizer, wash by hand or in the dishwasher. We recommend that you replace the pacifier every month and always at the first signs of damage or weakness. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months."

            "Make your home a safer place for your child to play in and explore with the Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener. Help keep curious little hands away from potentially-dangerous electrical outlets with this outlet plug cover. Covering the entire outlet, the cover keeps excess appliance cords off the floor, storing up to four feet of cords, depending on thickness. Easily remove and replace the outer cover with the child-resistant dual-press operation by simply pressing both side tabs simultaneously, while gently pulling the cover away. Along with appliances like lamps, televisions, and computers, the outlet cover works great with standard-size phone chargers, safely winding their cables out of sight. This kit includes one replacement wall plate and cover. A flat-head screwdriver is needed for installation. Remove the cover to clean, wiping it with a damp cloth and allowing it to dry. Safety 1st believes parenting should have fewer worries and more joyful moments, so you enjoy every \u201cfirst\u201d your child experiences.  NOTE: For use only with standard (duplex) receptacle having a center screw. Replaces existing wallplate. Not for use with appliances of 600 watts or more, and not for use with extension cords supporting more than one item each. Excess heat may build up.",

            "Philips AVENT SCF355/00 Bottle and Baby Food Warmer is a safe and easy way to make mealtime more comfortable for your baby. Once switched on, the warmer gently heats bottles and food within 3 minutes. Its compact size makes it easy to store on a kitchen countertop or bedside table for nighttime feedings. The warmer heats bottles and foods safely and evenly and unlike microwaves, won't cause hotspots, so you can be sure the internal temperature is safe for your baby. All Philips AVENT bottles, toddler cups, and food jars fit in the warmer. The warmer is fast and easy to operate - just plug in and flip the on/off switch on the back of the unit. A neon light lets you know the unit is on and working. An included instruction guide makes it easy to calculate the correct heat-up time. Operation involves adding water and turning the dial. A light blinks to indicate that the contents are properly warmed to a safe temperature. To be sure, always test the internal temperature before giving to babies."

            "Meals are an important part of family time. Enjoy more laughter and conversation \u2013 including baby talk \u2013 by giving your little one a seat at the table with this feeding chair. The Ingenuity Baby Base 2-in-1 Seat in Cashmere\u200b easily attaches to dining chairs so your baby can sit up higher and see more during family dinners. This portable baby feeding seat works just as well sitting with you at the table or as a floor seat during playtime. The removable tray gives your baby their own perfectly sized table, so snacks or toys are easily within reach. When not in use, the tray conveniently tucks away right underneath the booster seat itself. As your baby grows, you can remove the foam seat insert and convert the baby booster into a toddler seat. For all those meals in between, you can count on the wipeable seat and dishwasher-safe tray to leave you more time for family catch-up and less for kitchen clean-up."

        "description": [
            "Philips Avent Anti-colic with AirFree vent bottles are designed to reduce feeding issues: such as colic, gas, and reflux. The unique AirFree vent is designed to draw air away from the nipple keeping it full of milk to avoid air ingestion. This vent also keeps the nipple full of milk even when the bottle is held horizontal, allowing for upright feeding. Feeding in an upright position can help to reduce reflux and aid in digestion. The nipple shape is designed for a secure latch for a comfortable feed. The bottle is easy to clean and assemble with few parts. The AirFree vent is only one piece and is easy to clean without any special tools. The Anti-colic bottle features a valve, integrated into the nipple, that reduces vacuum buildup and reducing air into your baby\u2019s tummy. The Anti-colic bottle can be used with or without the AirFree vent, giving you the option based on your baby\u2019s feeding needs. The soft silicone nipple is available in different flow rates for babies of all ages, flows 1-4. We recommend using the Philips Avent Anti-colic baby bottle with Philips Avent Anti-colic bottle nipples. Includes 1 9oz Anti-colic bottles with AirFree vent with Flow 2 nipples. SCY703/91"

Unlike other baby washes, our tear-free and hypoallergenic baby wash and shampoo is made with 100 percent skin-natural nutrients, which are identical to those naturally found in skin, and prebiotic moisture to help replenish the essential moisture and nutrients that baby\u2019s skin can lose during bath time. This fragrance free baby bath wash is safety-tested and pediatrician recommended. And our caring formula is gentle enough to use on newborns and free of dyes, parabens, sulfates, and phthalates. To use this baby wash, gently wet baby\u2019s hair and skin with warm water, work into a lather, and rinse for touchably soft skin. We know there\u2019s no right or wrong way to be a parent \u2013 only your way. That\u2019s why Baby Dove is here to help give you confidence that you\u2019re providing the best skin care for your baby's skin. Our Fragrance Free Moisture Hypoallergenic Baby Wash is sold in 13 oz. and 20 oz. bottles. Looking for something for a calming bedtime routine? Look for our Baby Dove Calming Moisture Baby Wash and Shampoo."

            "Keep baby calm with a binky that you will both love. The MAM Clear Collection Pacifier was developed by leading pediatric dentists and developmental psychologists to provide maximum comfort and style for babies from birth to six months.* MAM pacifiers for babies feature an innovative nipple designed to promote healthy oral development so you can soothe your baby with confidence. Baby will love latching onto the soothing pacifier nipple that, with the help of a built-in air channel, naturally flattens and extends when sucked, mimicking a human nipple during breastfeeding. And all MAM pacifiers are orthodontic, featuring a symmetrical nipple that fits perfectly in baby's mouth at any angle. MAM's medically engineered nipples all feature life-like, SkinSoft textured silicone that feels more natural, just like mom. With multiple pacifier shapes and shield sizes to pick from, MAM nipples are easily accepted by babies of all ages, with 94% nipple acceptance among babies tested.** Babies simply love the ease and comfort of latching onto MAM nipples. Plus, the sterilizing storage case makes it easy to keep baby safe from germs with fast, easy cleaning right in the box. Microwave disinfection is proven effective in killing common household germs and bacteria. Pacifiers kept in the closed box will remain disinfected for up to 48 hours: Fill pacifier case with water. Place pacifier in the pacifier case with the nipple facing down. Follow pacifier package instructions for microwave setting. Cool completely before use. *Developed with the International Children's Medical Research Society. ** Market Research 2009-2017, tested with 1,508 babies."

            "Our most earth conscious diapers yet feature a wetness indicator, better absorption & blowout protection, cloud-like comfort and unique features for each babe stage \u2013 all while using less material and helping save over 7000 trees every single year. Plus, a secure, comfy fit for less sag + more swag. What Makes A Clean Conscious Diaper? To make the core of the diaper, we harvest wood from sustainably managed pine + spruce trees in Scandinavia, which is then turned into fluff pulp at a Swedish mill using totally chlorine-free processing \u2013 aka no dioxins (toxic chemicals) in our waterway. We don't add latex, fragrance, or parabens. We use a 100% plant-based backsheet, and our new, more efficient design reduces the amount of material used in each diaper. Our diapers are cruelty-free and never tested on animals. Our diaper boxes are made from 100% PCR post recycled consumer cardboard (aka they\u2019re 100% recyclable) \u2013 that means no new trees cut down and no landfill, if recycled."

            "Keep it cool with the Chicco 9oz. Flip-Top Straw Cup. The double-wall design provides insulation essential for keeping cold drinks cool longer, and the soft silicone straw is easy to keep clean. Gentle sipping activates the flow of liquid from the straw, so you can flip the cup upside down and all around. You can cover the straw between drinks with the integrated flip-top closure. Just slide the cover over the straw to easily hide it away. The contoured shape of the cup is specially designed for tiny hands to grab and hold. Ergonomic indents guide hand placement, helping baby prepare for proper cup holding. The insulated Flip-Top Straw Cup is loved by kids and parents alike with stylish colors and mix-and-match tops and bottoms for the perfect cup. Like all Chicco cups, the Flip-Top Straw Sippy Cup fits easily in stroller, car and car seat cup holders for convenient access and easy storage. When you\u2019re done with the cup for the day, quickly and easily wash all parts which are easy to remove and top-rack dishwasher safe. With minimal parts that are interchangeable, the Chicco Insulated Flip-Top Straw Cup is exactly what every parent needs: functional, minimalistic, easy-to-clean and loved by big and little kids alike. Suitable for children aged 12+ months."

            "The Magic Sleepsuit is a patented swaddle transition product that helps transition babies from the swaddle by providing them with a cozy, secure feeling. The Magic Sleepsuit was created by a mother of four who is a pediatric physical therapist to improve the quality and duration of her babies' sleep. The Magic Sleepsuit is designed for back sleeping in the bare crib only in a room at the recommended temperature for babies. The Magic Sleepsuit should not be used for co-sleeping, or with any sleep positioners. The Microfleece Magic Sleepsuit has a soft, breathable jersey cotton inner layer, a soft microfleece outer layer and a layer of polyfil in between for just enough comfort. The Magic Sleepsuit is designed to be introduced at approximately three months of age when babies are transitioning from the swaddle. Babies should be transitioned out of the Magic Sleepsuit when they roll over or try to roll over in it and are ready for more freedom of movement in their sleep. The Magic Sleepsuit provides your baby with a cozy and calming sleep environment that will become a consistent part of their sleep routine. The Magic Sleepsuit is designed to aid in baby's sleep patterns, and give parents peace of mind that their baby is getting adequate rest necessary for appropriate growth and development."

With 5 ways to play, this activity mat is super flexible for whatever your baby's age or stage needs. You can even adjust the plush walls down or up to fill the play gym with 40 colorful balls, making the joy last through the toddler years. Mom and dad can get in on the action (and get lots of co-play bonding time) by dropping the balls through the mesh canopy hole. As baby grows up, he can practice motor skills by dropping the balls himself. For younger babies, the jumbo playmat lays flat for tummy time (psst, we even added in a tummy time prop pillow). The cheerful elephant toy plays music and lights up to catch and keep baby's attention. You'll love the Totally Tropical fashion complete with toucans, palm trees and more. Playtime is all around with 6 additional toys: bead chaser, safari-themed crinkle toy, baby-safe mirror, flash cards, hanging leaf toy and bead rattle. Who's ready to have a ball with Bright Starts."

            "Soothes and treats your baby's nappy rash. Metanium nappy rash ointment is a topical ointment which rubs easily into the skin to treat nappy rash. Metanium ointment is specifically formulated to soothe and effectively treat nappy rash. Even the most absorbent nappy leaves some moisture on a baby's delicate new skin. A baby left in a dirty nappy for too long may also develop nappy rash. Nappy rash can appear on the bottoms of babies with particularly sensitive skin even if the nappy is changed frequently. The most common cause of nappy rash is from micro-organisms in babys faeces coming into contact with urine to produce ammonia. This causes a change in the ph levels of the skin and the resulting irritation which can lead to nappy rash. A babys skin is nearly half as thin as that of adults and therefore more delicate and prone to damage. Metanium ointment is specifically formulated to soothe and effectively treat nappy rash. Metanium ointment is a protective ointment that can be used at every nappy change and especially at bedtime when your baby will not be changed for a while. Metanium ointment rubs easily into the skin and creates a barrier between babys delicate skin and the irritants in urine and faeces helping to treat and prevent nappy rash"

Never dip nipple in sweet substances or medication, your child may get tooth decay.

            "The Transitional Swaddle Sack is the easiest & safest way to wean baby from a traditional swaddle. The arms up sleeve design allows baby to self-soothe and the unique \u00bd-length sleeves with foldover mitten cuffs closed provide partial suppression of the Startle Reflex to promote better sleep. Importantly, the patented design is safer because baby can use their arms if baby rolls over during sleep. The Transitional Swaddle Sack is ideal for babies who prefer to sleep with arms up, babies who are starting to rollover, and babies who break out of a traditional swaddle. The uniquely-shaped, \u00bd-length sleeves are not full length, so when mitten cuffs are closed, baby\u2019s arms will be flexed close to body for swaddle snugness. The foldover mitten cuffs may be worn open or closed. Caregiver can open one or both cuffs, so baby can self-soothe by sucking directly on hand. Helpful 2-way zipper with 2 zipper pulls. The zipper zips down from the top to make it easy to place baby in the sack and zips up from the bottom to make it easy to change baby\u2019s diaper. Designed by a nurse.

The legs lock at the ideal height for growing tots, and soft, flexible flaps hold disposable bags securely in place. Three disposable bags with absorbent pads are included, and refills are available, plus the Potty can accommodate standard plastic bags in a pinch. The legs fold all the way out and non-slip grips keep the Potty stable on round or elongated public toilets. The small seat is sized for little bottoms and the generous shield prevents splatter. The smooth surfaces are easy to clean and the legs fold in, allowing the Potty to fit into the included travel bag for storage in cars, strollers or diaper bags."

Every PUCK cartridge comes packed with a punch of lavender-scented baking soda, powered by Arm & Hammer. Whenever you're not using your STEP or PAIL diaper pail, fear not! PUCK works while the pails' lids are closed to ensure everything remains fresh and free of unwanted odors. It's recommended that you replace PUCK every 60-90 days for best results, and it can even be used beyond the pail (e.g. in garbage cans, diaper bags, etc.)!",

            "The Munchkin Bristle Bottle Brush features a patented suction cup base, so when scrubbing is done, you simply pop it onto the countertop to keep it upright, fast-drying and off of counters. The non-slip handle gives soapy hands a firm grip, and sturdy nylon bristles are tough on dirt, yet gentle on baby's bottles. Since nobody has time for flinging soapy water around the kitchen, we developed our bristles to reduce the dreaded splash-back when it pops out of the bottle opening. We know baby bottles come in all shapes and sizes so we added a new flexing neck to help get into every bottle with ease. Just when you thought we couldn't cram in any more features into such a small package - there's also a convenient soft rubber nipple brush inside the handle, making this brush equally suited for cleaning pump parts, valves, and other small bottle accessories, too. The Bristle Bottle Brush keeps your bottle cleaning routine sanitary and your sanity intact, so you only need to worry about the bottle parts, pots and pans you can see, not the dirty stuff you can't."

            "The Munchkin 4 White Hot Safety Spoons are intelligent spoons that help you feed your little one safely as they let you know when the food is too hot. Starting solids? It's a fun, but at times tricky, milestone to figure out - you're constantly questioning whether food is too hot, too cold, or just right. These innovative White Hot Safety Spoons can help make those first feedings easier to swallow for both of you. Simply dip the tips of the spoons in heated pureed baby foods to check if it's too warm. If the tip turns white, the food is too hot for baby to eat. Wait for it to cool, dip again, and if the tip is no longer white - voila! You can feed your little one without worrying. Age: 4m+ . Dimensions: 3x17x2cm. Box Dimensions: 22x10x2cm."

            "Keep baby calm with a binky that you will both love. The MAM Animal Pacifier was developed by leading pediatric dentists and developmental psychologists to provide maximum comfort and style for babies six months and older.* MAM pacifiers feature an innovative nipple designed to promote healthy oral development so you can soothe your baby with confidence. Baby will love latching onto the soothing pacifier nipple that, with the help of a built-in air channel, naturally flattens and extends when sucked, mimicking a human nipple during breastfeeding. And all MAM pacifiers are orthodontic, featuring a symmetrical nipple that fits perfectly in baby's mouth at any angle. MAM's medically engineered nipples all feature life-like, SkinSoft textured silicone that feels more natural, just like mom. With multiple pacifier shapes and shield sizes to pick from, MAM nipples are easily accepted by babies of all ages, with 94% nipple acceptance among babies tested.** Babies simply love the ease and comfort of latching onto MAM nipples. *Developed with the International Children's Medical Research Society. ** Market Research 2009-2017, tested with 1,508 babies."

        "description": [
            "The Philips AVENT Fast Baby Bottle Warmer SCF358/00 is a safe and easy way to make mealtime more comfortable for baby. It gently heats a 5 ounce bottle in as few as 3 minutes. Milk circulates continuously while it's warming, so the warmer - unlike a microwave - won't cause hot spots. The warmer can be used not only to warm milk, but also to defrost frozen breast milk and baby food. It is compatible with all Philips AVENT bottles, bottles from most other leading brands, and baby food jars. The Philips Avent Fast Baby Bottle Warmer allows you to set it and forget it. Sensors automatically adjust the heating pattern for different milk volumes and starting temperatures, so the warmer hits the right temperature every time with the push of a button. It also keeps milk warmed to the desired temperature for up to 60 minutes. After 60 minutes it automatically shuts off to prevent overheating, giving you peace of mind if you get distracted or fall asleep after a late night feeding. The front panel is intuitive and easy to read with clear guidance on setting by milk volume for accurate results. A progress light lights up in three segments, indicating the warming progress and when milk is ready. The warmer is compact so it's easy to store on a kitchen counter or bedside table for nighttime feedings. Always test milk or food temperature before giving to babies. Warms 5 ounces of milk in 3 minutes. Voltage: 120 - 127 volts, 60 Hertz."

The wide breast-shaped nipple on the Natural bottle promotes a natural latch-on so you can easily combine breastfeeding and bottle feeding. The ultra soft nipple mimics the feel of the breast. Our flexible spiral design combined with the comfort petals allow for a natural movement while baby feeds. The bottles have unique Airflex valve technology integrated into the nipple which is designed to reduce colic and discomfort by venting air away from your baby's tummy. The ergonomic shape makes it comfortable for parents to hold and easy for small fingers to grasp. Assembly is simple with only a few parts and the wide bottle neck makes filling and cleaning easy. The Natural bottle is made from polypropylene, a BPA free material, and works with all nipples and caps from the Natural line. (SCF013/47)."

With a sturdy, unique design and extra tall back panel, the Seat Guardian is built to last so you can use it with all of your car seats as your baby grows, from birth to eight years. Safety is our priority so the crash tested Dual Grip Traction technology helps prevent the car seat from unwanted movement to help keep your child's seat in the proper position. The rear facing kick mat even helps you follow best safety practices by protecting your seats so you can keep your toddler in a rear facing seat longer. The product measures 45\" L x 20\" W."

            "Your options have never been better with Dr. Brown\u2019s Natural Flow\u00ae Anti-Colic Options+\u2122 Wide-Neck Glass Baby Bottle. The anti-colic internal vent system is clinically proven to reduce colic. Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae bottles provide a more comfortable feeding experience for baby by decreasing spit-up, burping and gas. This vacuum-free feeding is closest to breastfeeding and Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae silicone nipples provide a consistent flow so baby can feed at their own pace. The breast-like nipple shape encourages a proper latch for a more natural bottle feeding experience and eases the transition from breast to bottle and back again. Dr. Brown\u2019s vent system is proven to help preserve bottle milk nutrients and aids in digestion for a better night\u2019s sleep. The silicone nipple, together with the internal vent system, offer a reliable and trusted bottle feeding experience that makes Dr. Brown\u2019s the #1 Pediatrician Recommended Baby Bottle in the U.S.* Dr. Brown\u2019s\u00ae Glass bottles are heat and thermal shock-resistant, which can withstand hot and cold temperatures, along with gradual temperature changes. Made to grow with baby, our bottle is designed to nourish through all of baby\u2019s feeding stages and is recyclable. Safe for use in dishwasher (top rack only), electric and microwave sterilizers or boiling water. BPA Free."

            "The instinctive action of sucking helps to calm and soothe babies and all parents know there\u2019s nothing more wonderful than a calm, content baby. When mom\u2019s breast isn\u2019t available, our Breast-like pacifier is the next best thing for baby to latch onto in between feeds. This pacifier glows in the dark for up to 8 hours which allows parents to locate the pacifier in a dark room without having to disturb baby. During the day your pacifier will recharge in natural light. Inspired by our award-winning Closer to Nature\u00ae nipple, this super soft silicone pacifier feels, moves, flexes and stretches just like skin so there\u2019s less chance of confusion when feeding baby from breast or bottle - perfect if you\u2019re worried that offering your baby a pacifier may disrupt breast or bottle feeding. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no \u2018wrong\u2019 side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your baby\u2019s mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The pacifier shield curves away from baby\u2019s face and offers superior ventilation and extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby\u2019s delicate skin against irritation. We recommend that you replace the pacifier every month and always at the first signs of damage or weakness. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months. Warning! Do not tie pacifier around child\u2019s neck as it presents a strangulation danger."

            "The Philips AVENT My Bendy Straw Cup 10oz is the ideal choice for the growing, active toddler. This dentist recommended cup was developed alongside experts in order to make it our best straw cup possible and one that allows for healthy oral development. The cup's contoured shape and anti-slip texture grips make it easy for little hands to hold the cup. The 10oz cup is the perfect size to keep your child hydrated throughout the day and through active times. With this straw cup, your child will be able to drink 'til the very last drop thanks to the Philips Avent unique bent-straw- the lower part of the straw is elongated and bends forward ensuring the straw easily reaches the cup's contents and allows the development of a natural drinking position. The cup has an integrated anti-leak valve to prevent spills (even when the cup is open) and the flip-top protects the straw and prevents leakage while on-the-go. Our advanced technology ensures that the cup is leak-proof all of the time, and comes with a 100% Leak-proof Money Back Guarantee in the case it should not deliver on this promise. For your convenience, this product is BPA-Free, dishwasher safe and compatible with Philips Avent Natural and Anti-Colic bottles & all other sippy cups. Mix and match our bottle and cup parts, and create the product that works for you, when you need it. 90% of 200 U.S. pediatric dentists agree that the design of the Philips Avent straw cup allows healthy oral development. 86% of those dentists would recommend this Philips Avent straw cup."

Munchkin's innovative white hot safety spoons can help make those first feedings easier to swallow for both of you. Simply dip the tips of the spoons in heated pureed baby foods to check if it's too warm. If the tip turns white, the food is too hot for baby to eat. Wait for it to cool, dip again, and if the tip is no longer white-voila. You can feed your little one without worrying about a thing.",

            "The MAM feed and soothe gift set includes 4 anti-colic bottles, 2 each of 5 ounce and 8 ounce. Also included are 2 MAM 0-6 months silicone pacifiers. The anti-colic bottle is just one of the innovative developments from the MAM design studio. Its vented base has small air holes and a silicone seal that allows for maximum air flow in while still preventing milk from leaking out. The vented base ensures controlled milk flow by balancing air pressure inside the bottle. Liquid is also pushed towards the nipple allowing it to retain its shape and preventing it from collapsing. All anti-colic bottles use MAM's patented ultra soft silicone nipple. Transitioning from breast to bottle is simple because MAM ultra soft silicone nipples feel most like mom's breast. For babies that have become accustomed to feeding from a bottle, the baby bottle comfortably fits in baby's hands, and similar to the anti-colic bottle, features MAM's ultra soft silicone nipple. BPA-free, lead-free, PVC-free and phthalate-free. Four bottles and four slow flow nipples and 4 caps included. 2 0-6 month. MAM 0-6 months orthodontic pacifiers have been developed in cooperation with the international children medical research society and are recommended most by dentists and orthodontists. MAM's patented silk teat is silicone with a difference: it's silky soft. No other silicone feels softer. For your baby's next step, MAM designers have worked closely together with orthodontists to create this range of MAM pacifiers. A curved shield with air holes and MAM's unique inside surface for maximum comfort. To add a lovely detailed touch, the colors and motifs are adapted to reflect the baby's age. MAM pacifiers are always in the right position. MAM pacifiers with silicone nipple. 0+months, unisex colors."
