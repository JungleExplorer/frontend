All of his books have been New York Times bestsellers, with over 105 million copies sold worldwide, in more than 50 languages, including over 75 million copies in the United States alone.', 'Sparks wrote one of his best-known stories, The Notebook, over a period of six months at age 28. It was published in 1996 and he followed with the novels Message in a Bottle (1998), A Walk to Remember (1999), The Rescue (2000), A Bend in the Road (2001), Nights in Rodanthe (2002), The Guardian (2003), The Wedding (2003), True Believer (2005) and its sequel, At First Sight (2005), Dear John (2006), The Choice (2007), The Lucky One (2008), The Last Song (2009), Safe Haven (2010), The Best of Me (2011), The Longest Ride (2013), See Me (2015), Two by Two (2016), Every Breath (2018), The Return (2020), and The Wish (2021) as well as the 2004 non-fiction memoir Three Weeks With My Brother, co-written with his brother Micah. His twenty-third novel, Dreamland, was published on September 20, 2022.', 'Film adaptations of Nicholas Sparks novels, including The Choice, The Longest Ride, The Best of Me, Safe Haven (on all of which he served as a producer), The Lucky One, Message in a Bottle, A Walk to Remember, The Notebook, Nights in Rodanthe, Dear John and The Last Song, have had a cumulative worldwide gross of over three-quarters of a billion dollars. The Notebook has also been adapted into a musical, featuring music and lyrics by Ingrid Michaelson.', 'Sparks lives in North Carolina. He contributes to a variety of local and national charities, and is a major contributor to the Creative Writing Program (MFA) at the University of Notre Dame, where he provides scholarships, internships, and a fellowship annually. He co-founded The Epiphany School in New Bern, North Carolina in 2006. As a former full scholarship athlete (he still holds a track and field record at the University of Notre Dame) he also spent four years coaching track and field athletes at the local public high school. In 2009, the team he coached at New Bern High School set a World Junior Indoor Record in the 4\u00d7400 meters, as well as US High School National Records in the 800 Medley and 1600 Medley.', 'The Nicholas Sparks Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, was founded in 2011, to provide scholarships and fund educational programs for underprivileged and disadvantaged youth. Between the foundation, and the personal gifts of the Sparks family, more than $15 million dollars have been distributed to deserving charities, scholarship programs, and projects. Because the Sparks family covers all operational expenses of the foundation, 100% of donations are devoted to programs.']}"

            "The Texas Instruments TI-30X IIS 2-Line Scientific Calculator features two-line display and other advanced features users get with the TI-30X IIS. The display shows the equation you are creating on the top line, and the numbers or symbols you are currently entering on the second line. Once the equation is solved, the results are displayed on the second line, and you can use the four arrow keys on the front of the calculator to edit the original equation in any way you like for a recalculation. Better still, pressing the up arrow repeatedly lets you browse through a cache of dozens of previous calculations, meaning you can look back to see the answer to a problem. The device uses solar power when possible but can fall back on the internal batteries (which are included) if there isn't enough light. There are three angle modes (degrees, radians, and grads), scientific and engineering notation modes, and even one- or two-variable statistical modes. Five variables can also be assigned to their own memory slots. The calculator comes with a Snap-On cover that fits on the back of the device. Key Features: \u2022Two-line display \u2022Fraction features \u2022Conversions \u2022Basic scientific and trigonometric functions \u2022Edit, cut, and paste entries \u2022Solar and battery powered \u2022One- and two-variable statistics Ideal For: \u2022General math \u2022Pre-Algebra \u2022Algebra 1 and 2 \u2022Geometry \u2022Statistics \u2022General science"

She originates from a place called Teesside on that little but awesomely sunny (okay I exaggerate) Isle called Great Britain. She was brought up surrounded by her mother -- a farmer's daughter, her crazy Scottish father, a savagely sarcastic sister and a multitude of rescue animals and horses.\", 'Being a scary blend of Scottish and English, Tillie embraces both cultures; her English heritage through her love of HP sauce and freshly made Yorkshire Puddings, and her Scottish, which is mostly demonstrated by her frighteningly foul-mouthed episodes of pure rage and her much loved dirty jokes.', \"Having been born and raised as a Teesside Smoggie, Tillie, at age nineteen, moved thirty miles north to the 'Toon', Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, where she attended University and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts honours degree in Religious Studies. She returned two years later to complete a Post-Graduate Certificate in Teaching High School Social Studies. She regards Newcastle to be a home from home and enjoyed the Newcastle Geordie way of life for seven 'proper mint', 'lush' years.\", 'Tillie, from a very young age has been part of the theatre community and loves nothing more than to entertain through the mediums of cheerleading, dance, drama and singing (sometimes in the rain). She can also be found in nightclubs around the world imitating her favourite artists alongside her crazy BFF\u2019s - The Teesside Massive - or, sat on the front row at the theatre bopping along to her favourite musical, \u2018The Rocky Horror Picture Show \u2019, clad in a only a maids outfit, clutching a bag of rice and sporting a vibrant shade of red lipstick.', 'One summers day, after finishing reading her thousandth book on Kindle, Tillie turned to her husband and declared, \"D\\'you know, I have a great idea for a story. I could write a book.\" Several months later, repeating the same tired line, she was scolded by her husband to shut up talking about writing a novel and \\'just bloody do it!\\' Immediately she set off on a crazy journey, delving deep into her fertile imagination. Tillie, ever since, has written from the heart. She combines her passion for anything camp and glittery with her love of humour and dark brooding men (most often muscled and tattooed \u2013 they\u2019re her weakness!).', 'After years of teaching high school Social Studies and following her Professional Rugby Player husband around Europe, they have settled in Calgary, Alberta where Tillie spends most of her days (and many a late night) lost in a writing euphoria or in her dream of pursuing a dazzling career as a barrel-racing, tasselled-chap, Stetson-wearing cowgirl... Ye-haw!']}"

            "From Publishers Weekly",
            "The main drama in Bronte's novel happens in a long narrative told by an elderly housekeeper to a convalescing new tenant. This story-within-a-story setup makes it well suited for audio adaptation, as Scales takes the housekeeper's part and relates the past, while West performs as the tenant and describes the present. Scales primarily uses a folksy lower-class accent, but she also makes her voice harsh and threatening when speaking as Heathcliff, the surly man at the novel's heart. West, as the bewildered tenant, manages to sound both nervous and pretentious, but his part is fairly small, especially with this abridgment, so he mostly serves to provide transitions for the housekeeper's story. The extensive abridgment generally deletes sentences and phrases rather than entire paragraphs or sections. One drawback for the audio format is the difficulty of clarifying the novel's convoluted plot and family tree, since it's harder to search back through long CD tracks than through earlier chapters of the paperback. While a little of the depth of Bronte's writing is lost in abridgment, the novel's emotional core remains intact and wrenching, and the actors' heartfelt interpretations make it easy to imagine being curled up by a warm fire listening to an absorbing tale. In June, Penguin Audio remastered and released on CD for the first time nine other Penguin Classics: Crime and Punishment, Dracula, Frankenstein, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, Moby Dick, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Tale of Two Cities.

            "Grade 8 Up-British actor Martin Shaw reads this shortened version of the classic Emily Bronte novel. His easily-understood accent is appropriate and helps to set the mood. Shaw reads at a very steady pace, pausing effectively for emphasis or when his character might be thinking. Usually calm and gentle, his voice can resonate with anger or other emotion when necessary. There is some differentiation in pitch to emphasize male vs. female speech, but it is not exaggerated or overdone. The abridgement retains Bronte's words linking speech or narration sometimes from one page to another. It provides students with an easier way to become familiar with the story and get a feel for her style. Teachers could use this presentation to introduce the novel or to entice students to read it on their own.",

            "is a classic tale of possessive and thwarted passion, one of the forerunners of today's soap operas and romance novels. The tempestuous and mythic story of Catherine Earnshaw, the precocious daughter of the house, and the ruggedly handsome, uncultured foundling her father brings home and names Heathcliff, is played out against the backdrop of English moors no less wild and raw than the love they develop for one another. Brought together as children, Catherine and Heathcliff quickly become attached to each other. As they grow older, their companionship turns into obsession. Family, class, and fate work cruelly against them, as do their own jealous and volatile natures, and much of their lives is spent in revenge and frustration. Yet there is something magnificent about the depth and intensity of their love. Even as you condemn Catherine and Heathcliff for the pain they inflict upon themselves and others, it is hard not to listen in awe when Catherine cries out \"I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind; not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.\"",

            "More than 150 years and many cultural upheavals later, Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s novel remains almost blindingly original, undimmed in its power to convey the destructive potential of thwarted passion as expressed through the unappeasable fury of a rejected lover. To paraphrase Shakespeare, age cannot wither it, nor custom stale its infinite variety. Every aspect of the novel\u2014whether it be the writer\u2019s expert grasp of the laws pertaining to land and personal property, her meticulous rendering of local dialect, or her use of multiple narrators\u2014has been put under microscopic study. And yet, despite the shelf after shelf of books that have been written in the attempt to understand the frail yet flinty-willed young woman\u2014\"the sphinx of literature,\" as she was called by Angus M. Mackay in",
            "The Bront\u00ebs: Fact and Fiction",
            "(1897)\u2014who wrote it, as well as the tragedy-struck, remarkably talented family from which she came,",
            "Wuthering Heights",
            "still presents a dark and fierce view of the world that is seemingly without precedent. The book\u2019s autobiographical components aroused interest from the start, especially given the original mystery surrounding its authorship. Lucasta Miller, in",
            "The Bront\u00eb Myth",
            ", gives an often spellbinding account of the ways in which the Bront\u00ebs\u2019 \"lonely moorland lives\" (p. xi) lent themselves to the process of mythification even before the last sister had died. (None of them lived to see forty: Anne died within five months of Emily, at the age of twenty-nine, and Charlotte, the only one of the sisters to marry, was in the early months of pregnancy at the time of her death, at the age of thirty-nine.) But unlike Charlotte, who lived long enough to help shape the myth that would grow up around the Bront\u00ebs, beginning with Elizabeth Gaskell\u2019s landmark",
            "Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb",
            ", which appeared in 1857 and for which she was the primary source, Emily wasn\u2019t around to answer for herself. \"All of Emily\u2019s biographers have had to cope with the absences surrounding her,\" Miller notes (p. 193). The baroque conjectures concerning her character were first introduced by Gaskell\u2019s",
            "Life",
            ", which included scenes that had Emily pummeling her disobedient bulldog into submission with her bare hands and dramatically cauterizing a bite from a strange dog with a red-hot kitchen iron. Gaskell\u2019s two-dimensional portrait of Emily as kind of savage force of nature, \"a remnant of the Titans,\u2014great-grand-daughter of the giants who used to inhabit earth,\" held sway for decades, drawing admirers like the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, whose own provocative impulses (which included a well-documented sadomasochistic bent) were stirred by the novel\u2019s almost pagan quality, its disregard for bourgeois niceties. The efforts to penetrate Emily\u2019s veils grew even more overheated in the wake of Freud, just as the textual analyses would become more and more exotic in the trail of the new French theories of narrative propounded by Derrida and Foucault. One 1936 biographer, who featured herself as having paid \"especial and respectful\" attention to primary sources, misread the title of one of Emily\u2019s manuscript poems as \"Louis Parensell\" instead of \"Love\u2019s Farewell\" in her zeal to bring new light on a hypothesized lost lover, and then went on to unearth another dark secret, proposing that Emily had been \"a member of that beset band of women who can find their pleasure only in women\" (Moore,",
            "The Life and Eager Death of Emily Bront\u00eb",
            ". There were discussions as to how genuinely close Emily had been to her sisters Charlotte and Anne, or whether she in fact resented the older one and patronized the younger. Was she a domestic slouch, oblivious to all except her febrile imaginings and the wind howling over the moors? Or was she in fact something of a fifties housewife type, sweeping the floors, ironing the linens, and baking bread while her chronically depressed father took his meals in his room and her brother, Branwell, drank himself to death in the Black Bull tavern? Was her consuming interest in food and what was being prepared for meals by Tabby, the housekeeper, as evidenced by the few diary entries that have come down to us, a sign of a robust immersion in daily life or a clue to something more disturbing? (In",
            "A Chainless Soul",
            ", Frank makes a plausible case for diagnosing Emily as suffering an anorexic\u2019s death by starvation.) Some of the more unrestrained speculations tended to focus on the elusive genesis of",
            "Wuthering Heights",
            ". Emily\u2019s ill-fated brother, Branwell, who had been earmarked within the family for artistic glory (money was scraped together to send him to London to pursue his artistic interests) but died ignominiously at the age of thirty-one, a hostage to gin and opium, was at the center of the theories that swirled around the decades-long disputed authorship of Emily\u2019s novel. The controversy began with an article, published in 1867 and written by an acquaintance of Branwell\u2019s, himself an amateur poet, which claimed that the author had once read a manuscript of Branwell\u2019s that contained a scene and characters similar to those of",
            "Wuthering Heights",
            "(Miller, p. 229). This controversy\u2014or \"great Bront\u00eb conspiracy theory,\" as Miller describes it (p. 228)\u2014was fueled largely by disbelief that a reserved young daughter of a rural clergyman could have written so volcanic a book, but also on the basis of Branwell\u2019s having shown early literary promise as a coauthor of the Bront\u00eb children\u2019s joint writing efforts, an all-consuming escapist pastime that Charlotte would later refer to as their \"web of sunny air\" (Frank, p. 57). It was quickly taken up by other of Branwell\u2019s friends, and although it was eventually demolished in Irene Cooper Willis\u2019s",
            "The Authorship of Wuthering Heights",
            "(1936), the idea has continued to intrigue scholars and biographers up until the present day. But by far the most intense (and screwy) psychological scrutiny was reserved for the close relationship between Branwell and Emily. After Charlotte had given up on him as a bad egg, Emily continued to stand by her older brother, calming him down and getting him to bed during his drunken outbursts. This aspect of the Bront\u00eb family life led to speculations about a possible incestuous aspect to Branwell and Emily\u2019s relationship, especially in regard to its being the model for the relationship between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. (One theory suggested that Heathcliff was in fact the bastard son of Mr. Earnshaw and thus Catherine\u2019s half brother.) Of course, this theory clashed with yet another view that saw Branwell as doomed by his closet homosexuality, which may or may not have emerged during the period he spent as a live-in tutor to a young boy, Edward Robinson; his employment ended in disgrace after Branwell was dismissed with the threat of scandalous exposure if he tried to get in touch with any of the family. Branwell later retailed this scandal as an adulterous affair he was having with his pupil\u2019s mother.",

            "Gorilla Heavy Duty Mounting Tape (Pack of 3) is the new alternative to nails or screws, making it the perfect solution for your next project. The conformable double sided mounting tape immediately sticks to smooth and rough surfaces, alike, for an instant, long-lasting, weatherproof bond; this 3 pack adhesive acts easily as both indoor and outdoor double sided tape. The industrial strength double sided sticky tape delivers a heavy duty bond that holds up to 30 pounds. Mount, build and repair for a quick and easy finished project, every time. Directions: Apply double sided adhesive tape to back of object vertically, allowing for even distribution of weight. Avoid touching surface of tape. Note: Apply 2\u201d of 2 sided tape per 1lb of weight. Cut tape and press to secure tape to object. Remove clear liner and align object to desired placement. Press firmly, as Gorilla Heavy Duty Mounting Tape conforms to the surface and creates a strong, permanent bond. Once double face tape is used to mount an object, it is meant to be held in place permanently, and not be removed. Get a 3 pack of mounting tape to cover your entire DIY project in one order.

            "What is today? For a child, that simple question can have so many answers and this daily calendar helps satisfy them all! Kids will feel a greater sense of control and responsibility when they help post the day of the week, date, weather, and special events on the large magnetic board for all to see. There's even a space to post their mood an excellent way to open communication and encourage children to gauge their own emotions. Updating the information is simple: Simply take a preprinted magnet from the lower magnetic board (which hangs below the calendar to keep magnets within easy reach). Then place it on the calendar to fill in the information or make a custom magnet by writing on one of two dry-erase magnet tiles. There are fields for day, date, season, weather, temperature, activities, holiday, and mood. The Melissa & Doug My Magnetic Daily Calendar comes with 80 magnets, which include years, months, days of the week, holidays, emotions, and more. Our Melissa & Doug daily calendar encourages children to communicate with family members and friends, as their anticipation of upcoming events and special occasions is displayed on the calendar. The Magnetic Daily Calendar is an exceptional gift for kids ages 3 to 7 years. Add the Melissa & Doug Magnetic Responsibility Chart to round out the hands-on learning experience.

            "Product Description",
            "What is today? For a child, that simple question can have so many answers and this daily calendar helps satisfy them all! Kids will feel a greater sense of control and responsibility when they help post the day of the week, date, weather, and special events on the large magnetic board for all to see. There's even a space to post their mood an excellent way to open communication and encourage children to gauge their own emotions. Updating the information is simple: Simply take a preprinted magnet from the lower magnetic board (which hangs below the calendar to keep magnets within easy reach). Then place it on the calendar to fill in the information or make a custom magnet by writing on one of two dry-erase magnet tiles. There are fields for day, date, season, weather, temperature, activities, holiday, and mood. The Melissa & Doug My Magnetic Daily Calendar comes with 80 magnets, which include years, months, days of the week, holidays, emotions, and more. Our Melissa & Doug daily calendar encourages children to communicate with family members and friends, as their anticipation of upcoming events and special occasions is displayed on the calendar. The Magnetic Daily Calendar is an exceptional gift for kids ages 3 to 7 years. Add the Melissa & Doug Magnetic Responsibility Chart to round out the hands-on learning experience. For more than 30 years, Melissa & Doug has created beautifully designed imagination- and creativity-sparking products that NBC News called \u201cthe gold standard in early childhood play.\u201d Today, Melissa & Doug is proudly partnering with the American Academy of Pediatrics to foster early brain development and help children build important life skills through play.",

Though it takes a little effort to master the collection of financial worksheets available on the Texas Instruments BA II Plus, you'll be glad you invested the time and money in this fine financial calculator.",
            "The BA II Plus operates in standard calculator and worksheet modes. The standard mode lets you perform common math as well as operations involving the time value of money--that is, applications such as mortgages or annuities in which payments are equal and evenly spaced. You can also perform trigonometric functions in standard mode.",
            "The more hard-core worksheet mode includes tables for amortization, bond, depreciation, and compound interest. If you're not familiar with such calculations, the very helpful user's manual will guide you through the process. All previous worksheet values are stored in memory, so you don't have to retype all the bond maturity or cash flow analysis figures.",
            "The average user who wants to calculate a basic loan payment will be more comfortable working in the standard calculator mode. We were using the BA II Plus tools for calculating basic interest and payment periods within minutes. Still, it's good to know that the more advanced features are available for those who require heavy-duty financial computing.",

            "When I left my office that beautiful spring day, I had no idea what was in store for me. To begin with, everything was too perfect for anything unusual to happen. It was one of those days when a man feels good, feels like speaking to his neighbor, is glad to live in a country like ours, and proud of his government. You know what I mean, one of those rare days when everything is right and nothing is wrong. \u00a0 I was walking along whistling when I heard the dogfight. At first I paid no attention to it. After all it wasn\u2019t anything to get excited about, just another dogfight in a residential section. \u00a0 As the sound of the fight grew nearer, I could tell there were quite a few dogs mixed up in it. They boiled out of an alley, turned, and headed straight toward me. Not wanting to get bitten or run over, I moved over to the edge of the sidewalk. \u00a0 I could see that all the dogs were fighting one. About twenty-five feet from me they caught him and down he went. I felt sorry for the unfortunate one. I knew if something wasn\u2019t done quickly the sanitation department would have to pick up a dead dog. \u00a0 I was trying to make up my mind to help when I got a surprise. Up out of that snarling, growling, slashing mass reared an old redbone hound. For a second I saw him. I caught my breath. I couldn\u2019t believe what I had seen. \u00a0 Twisting and slashing, he fought his way through the pack and backed up under the low branches of a hedge. Growling and snarling, they formed a halfmoon circle around him. A big bird dog, bolder than the others, darted in. The hedge shook as he tangled with the hound. He came out so fast he fell over backwards. I saw that his right ear was split wide open. It was too much for him and he took off down the street, squalling like a scalded cat. \u00a0 A big ugly cur tried his luck. He didn\u2019t get off so easy. He came out with his left shoulder laid open to the bone. He sat down on his rear and let the world know that he had been hurt. \u00a0 By this time, my fighting blood was boiling. It\u2019s hard for a man to stand and watch an old hound fight against such odds, especially if that man has memories in his heart like I had in mine. I had seen the time when an old hound like that had given his life so that I might live. \u00a0 Taking off my coat, I waded in. My yelling and scolding didn\u2019t have much effect, but the swinging coat did. The dogs scattered and left. \u00a0 Down on my knees, I peered back under the hedge. The hound was still mad. He growled at me and showed his teeth. I knew it wasn\u2019t his nature to fight a man. \u00a0 In a soft voice, I started talking to him. \u201cCome on, boy,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m your friend. Come on now.\u201d \u00a0 The fighting fire slowly left his eyes. He bowed his head and his long, red tail started thumping the ground. I kept coaxing. On his stomach, an inch at a time, he came to me and laid his head in my hand. \u00a0 I almost cried at what I saw. His coat was dirty and mud-caked. His skin was stretched drum-tight over his bony frame. The knotty joints of his hips and shoulders stood out a good three inches from his body. I could tell he was starved. \u00a0 I couldn\u2019t figure it out. He didn\u2019t belong in town. He was far out of place with the boxers, poodles, bird dogs, and other breeds of town dogs. He belonged in the country. He was a hunting hound. \u00a0 I raised one of his paws. There I read the story. The pads were worn down slick as the rind on an apple. I knew he had come a long way, and no doubt had a long way to go. Around his neck was a crude collar. On closer inspection, I saw it had been made from a piece of check-line leather. Two holes had been punched in each end and the ends were laced together with bailing wire. \u00a0 As I turned the collar with my finger, I saw something else. There, scratched deep in the tough leather, was the name \u201cBuddie.\u201d I guessed that the crude, scribbly letters had probably been written by a little boy. \u00a0 It\u2019s strange indeed how memories can lie dormant in a man\u2019s mind for so many years. Yet those memories can be awakened and brought forth fresh and new, just by something you\u2019ve seen, or something you\u2019ve heard, or the sight of an old familiar face. \u00a0 What I saw in the warm gray eyes of the friendly old hound brought back wonderful memories. To show my gratitude, I took hold of his collar and said, \u201cCome on, boy, let\u2019s go home and get something to eat.\u201d \u00a0 He seemed to understand that he had found a friend. He came willingly. \u00a0 I gave him a bath and rubbed all the soreness from his muscles. He drank quarts of warm milk and ate all the meat I had in the house. I hurried down to the store and bought more. He ate until he was satisfied. \u00a0 He slept all that night and most of the next day. Late in the afternoon he grew restless. I told him I understood, and as soon as it was dark, he could be on his way. I figured he had a much better chance if he left town at night. \u00a0 That evening, a little after sundown, I opened the back gate. He walked out, stopped, turned around, and looked at me. He thanked me by wagging his tail. \u00a0 With tears in my eyes, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome, old fellow. In fact, you could\u2019ve stayed here as long as you wanted to.\u201d \u00a0 He whined and licked my hand.",

The zipper has a unique angled design to make it easier and quicker to zip things up when packed with your important papers and materials. The D-146 uses Kraft board instead of PE board to give its binders a firm, stiff shape that won't buckle or warp. The spine is specially designed so that your binder can lay flat when open, making it easier to add or take papers out, and to take notes in. Case-it produces quality binders offering unique organizational tools for school or home use."

            "About the product:1: More safety: Abandon the traditional pencil sharpener, reduce the damage of the pencilsharpener opponent, and provide a seat belt environment for your use.2: Easy clean: Pencil sharpeners are safer, but the cleaning of the pencil shavings creates problems.This product is simpler and easier to clean.3: Labor-saving: The automatic pen-shaving mode eliminates the traditional manual method andsaves time and effort.Note: Children under the age of three should be used under the supervision of adults. FAQ(Frequently Asked Questions)\uff1a Question: Does this sharpen colored pencils?Answer: friend, this light-duty electric pencil sharpener can sharpen No.2 Pencils, Colored Pencils, Eyebrow Pencils, HB & 2B to 4B Carbon Pencils and so on. Question: Do you have to grip the pencil tight? Is it easy enough for a 6-year-old to use?Answer: No, they don\u2019t have to grip it tightly. My other sharpener was awful, this one is amazing! Question: Can you get replacement blades?Answer: Yes, it comes with a replacement blade, one of which is powerful and still in use. Question: Just received my pencil sharpener. it works great. but can't seem to figure out how to replace the blades in it. is there a manual?Answer: Yes it came with a manual, just pull the blade out firmly, then place the new blade in firmly. No twisting just good hard pull. Hope this helps. Question: About how long will a set of batteries last?Answer: It really depends on how often you use it. I would say 6-8 months if you use it every few days. I use the Amazon batteries in mine, so I don't know if it would be different with other brands."

Magnet & adhesive work best when applied at above 60 degrees Fahrenheit or 15.56 degree Celsius. For best results: 1)Allow magnet to reach room temperature then cut magnet with heavy duty scissors or hobby knife. 2)Apply magnet's dark gray side to large metal surface for several hours to flatten curl. Do not roll magnet strip in opposite direction to remove curl. 3)Clean applicable surface for adhesive with isopropyl alcohol and allow to dry. 4)Peel back liner from the adhesive and place item on adhesive. 5)Apply adhesive to surface with firm pressure 6)Allow adhesive to cure for a minimum of 24 hours or 72 hours to reach maximum bond with surface."

            "Once you get to a certain level of math classes, a regular old calculator just isn't good enough anymore--you need a high-functioning calculator that can perform algebraic, trigonometric, and statistical problems in addition to general mathematical tasks. The Texas Instruments TI-30XA scientific calculator can do this for you. It is extremely handy when it comes to figuring tricky fractions. It can add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions when entered in a traditional numerator/denominator format. This calculator can also do a variety of conversions, from fractions to decimals, degrees to radians to grads, DMS to decimal to degrees, and polar to rectangular. The display screen holds up to 10 digits.",
            "For high school or college students tackling advanced math, this is a great tool (and a thoughtful back-to-school gift), and with more professors allowing the use of calculators during classes and exams, it's a necessary one. Easy to use and easy to slip into a backpack, the TI-30XA will soon become indispensable for both the serious and the striving math student.",

This combo is a perfect and well thought out design for Airports, Inspectors, Law Enforcement, including DHS, Police, Sheriff, Government Employees, Private Company Loss Prevention, and more. Simply load up to three badges from the top and they stay secure but easily removable and at the ready at all times. When you need to remove to swipe, scan, or tap your proximity or access pass proxcard at a scanner or checkpoint, just push up on the discreet thumb notch on the back and your photo identification card pops right up. Independent controls for front (visible) and back (hidden) cards. Note: 2-card multi space slot in the back will eject back sided cards together. Universal break-away lanyard with ring swivel hook attachment and id holder with work together as a bundle but can also be used with the retractable badge reel, lanyard or card holder you already have if you want to change something around."

More recently in 2012, a three-month study conducted by the Georgia Tech Research Institute found Dr. Grip Center of Gravity (COG) surpassed key competitors in overall comfort ratings for users both with and without arthritis. In the study, Dr. Grip COG was proven to be almost 2X more comfortable than key competitor brands*.",

In addition, Dr. Grip is offered in a variety of point types including Medium 1.0 mm ball point ink, Fine 0.7 mm gel ink, and #2 HB mechanical pencil lead.

            "A box of 20 blue BIC Orange Original Fine ballpoint pens with barrels that were, are and will always be orange. This ballpoint pen was introduced in 1961 for people looking for a precision writing instrument and features a uniquely fine 0.8 mm point. Taking after its big brother, the BIC Cristal Original, this pen offers the same state-of-the-art technological trio: a point, a perfectly spherical ball, and high-quality ink manufactured in the BIC plants. This system ensures even ink flow for accurate fineline writing and intricate drawings. BIC has been tirelessly improving the BIC Orange Original Fine pen since it came out. It gradually got lighter and the instant-dry ink is constantly being perfected for writing with an ever-gentler touch. BIC even gave it a twin brother: the Cristal Original Fine ballpoint pen that has a translucent orange barrel instead of an opaque one. A mark of quality. BIC makes this pen at its own plants in Europe using unmatched expertise that has been passed down the generations. BIC has it down to a fine art."

            "Make sure important paperwork stays with you for the long haul by storing it in an Avery Durable View Binder. This 1-1/2 inch white binder offers more protection than basic binders thanks to its tear-resistant DuraHinge spine and more flexible, DuraEdge split-resistant edges. Durable binders are also fully adhered with a deep-weave polypropylene cover that is resistant to bubbling, surface wrinkles, and is tear-resistant. The interior of this white 3 ring binder is just as impressive as its exterior. With back-mounted slant rings, your pages will never curl again. Pages lay flat and are easy to turn, while the cover opens and closes without pulling on your papers. Enjoy extra organization and storage capabilities with two interior clear pockets made of nonstick material that won't lift or transfer ink from your documents. As a school binder, this durable binder is tough enough to last the semester and then some, whether you're sticking it in your backpack every day or using it during remote learning. As a work binder, it's able to withstand frequent referencing, perfect for flipping through training materials. Have another use in mind? Durable binders are also great as recipe binders, music binders, photo albums, scrapbooks and more. For those who collect trading cards like Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh, pair this 3-ring binder with Avery's Trading Card Storage Sheets for effortless organization. This set includes 12 white binders. Each clear view binder holds up to 375 sheets of paper with 1-1/2 inch capacity slant rings and has a spine that is 2.1 inches wide. Rings are standard 3-hole spaced, have a secure locking mechanism, and accommodate 8.5\" x 11\" pages nicely. A wider front and back binder panel also ensures that standard dividers and sheet protectors are fully covered; a must for students. All Avery Durable binders are made with PVC-free material. Customize your view binder using the free templates, fonts, and designs at avery.com/templates."

I let my son go to town on the book itself and now he has completed it and we have no more use for it. --Amazon",

Since then, it has never stopped innovating to maximise the performance of its pens. For the BIC Cristal Soft pen, BIC developed the Easy Glide ink system that makes writing up to 35% smoother than regular BIC ballpoint pens. The winning hexagonal design is a brand icon. This pouch contains 10 blue pens with caps and end plugs to match the ink. BIC manufactures these pens at its own plants in Europe relying on unmatched expertise that has been passed down the generations.",

            "A new twist on a timeless classic. The 20 BIC Cristal Multicolour pens in this Doypack come in a cocktail of eight different hip eye-catching colours (two of each: purple, pink, lime green, turquoise, blue, black, green, red) plus two fluorescents (two of each: yellow and orange). Brighten up your notebook with a pen that has stood the test of time. French entrepreneur Marcel Bich started a writing revolution in 1950 when he introduced the first BIC Cristal ballpoint pen. Now called the BIC Cristal Original, it offered fast smudge-free writing. His invention offered an unbeatable trio: a point, a perfectly spherical ball, and high-quality ink manufactured in the BIC plants. Since then, BIC has been tirelessly improving the BIC Cristal pen. Over the years, the pen has gradually been made lighter and the ink is always being perfected for writing with an ever-gentler touch. A ubiquitous object known and loved by all, for decades the BIC Cristal ballpoint pens in this Multicolour Doypack has been an everyday part of life for countless people in every field from business to art. It is even part of the permanent collection at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne/Pompidou Centre in Paris and the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) where visitors still marvel at its timeless design. Because only BIC is as good as BIC."
