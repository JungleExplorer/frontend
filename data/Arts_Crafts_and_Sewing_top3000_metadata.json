            "Twilight",
            ", based on the acclaimed novel by Stephenie Meyer, is the highly-anticipated movie of the ultimate forbidden love affair between a vampire and mortal. Boasting a whole host of bright young talent including Robert Pattinson (",
            "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire",
            "), Kristen Stewart (",
            "Into The Wild, What Just Happened",
            ") and Cam Gigandet (",
            "Never Back Down, The O.C.",
            "), the screenplay is written by Melissa Rosenberg (",
            "Step Up, The O.C.",
            ") and directed by the award-winning filmmaker Catherine Hardwicke (",
            "Lords of Dogtown, Thirteen",
            "). Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn\u2019t expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a boy unlike any she\u2019s ever met. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands--and he hasn\u2019t aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he\u2019s immortal. But he doesn\u2019t have fangs, and he doesn\u2019t drink human blood, as Edward and his family are unique among vampires in their lifestyle choice. To Edward, Bella is that thing he has waited 90 years for--a soul mate. But the closer they get, the more Edward must struggle to resist the primal pull of her scent, which could send him into an uncontrollable frenzy. But what will they do when Laurent (Edi Gathegi) and James (Cam Gigandet), the Cullens\u2019 mortal vampire enemies, come to town, looking for Bella?"

            "B.How to Do It",
            "1. Clean Surface - prepare your target surface clean and dry, the smoother the surface the easier to transfer the vinyl. 2. Design with cutter - put on a cutting mat that has a sticky back and cut the design by cutting machines. 3. Weeding the excess vinyl - leave the letters/graphics on the sheet (hook tools work well). 4. Apply the transfer paper - gently put a transfer tape on the surface of the cut vinyl. Use a scraper over the design and make sure the transfer tape is adhering to the vinyl nice and tight. 5. Adhere it to the new clean and dry flat surface slowly- carefully work with delicate patterns. 6. Remove Transfer paper - rub the clear tape carefully from the center out to adhere the vinyl securely.",

            "Seattle, WashingtonIt all started with a second martini.\u201cCome on,\u201d Meghann said, \u201chave another drink.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d Elizabeth didn\u2019t handle alcohol well; God knew that had been proven conclusively back in 1976 when she\u2019d been at the University of Washington.\u201cYou can\u2019t refuse to drink at my forty-second birthday party. Remember how drunk I got last spring when you turned forty-five?\u201dWhat a debacle that had been.Meghann sensed hesitation, and like any good attorney, she pounced on it. \u201cI\u2019ll have Johnny pick us up.\u201d \u201cAre you sure Johnny\u2019s old enough to drive?\u201d\u201cNow, that hurts. All of my boyfriends have their driver\u2019s licenses.\u201d\u201cAnd I thought you had no standards.\u201d\u201cI keep them as low as possible.\u201d Meghann raised her hand and flagged down the waitress, who hurried over. \u201cWe\u2019ll take two more martinis. And bring us a plate of nachos\u2014heavy on the refried beans.\u201dElizabeth couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cThis is going to be ugly.\u201dThe waitress returned, set two elegant glasses down on the table, and picked up the empties.\u201cHere\u2019s to me,\u201d Meghann said, clinking her glass against Elizabeth\u2019s.For the next hour, their conversation drifted down old roads and around old times. They\u2019d been friends for more than twenty years. In the two decades since college, their lives had gone in opposite directions\u2014Elizabeth had put all her energies into wife-and-motherhood; Meghann had become a first-rate divorce attorney\u2014but their friendship had never wavered. For years, as Elizabeth and her family had moved from town to town, they\u2019d kept in touch via e-mail and phone calls. Now, finally, they lived close enough to see each other on special occasions. It was one of the things Elizabeth loved most about living in Oregon.By the time the third round was delivered, Meghann was laughing uproariously about the sound the cash register made.\u201cD\u2019ya see tha hunk o\u2019 burning love in the corner over there?\u201d Meg glanced slyly at a college-age boy sitting by the window. \u201cHe looks lonely.\u201d\u201cAnd look\u2014no braces. He probably got them taken off last week. He\u2019s just your type.\u201dMeghann dug through the nachos, looking for one with a lot of cheese on it. \u201cNot everyone is lucky enough to have married their college sweetheart, kiddo. Besides, I don\u2019t have a type anymore. I did once. Now I\u2019ll stick with what makes me happy.\u201dHappy. The word hit Elizabeth hard.\u201cI wonder if a big ole wet one from a birthday girl\u2014Birdie? What\u2019s the matter?\u201dElizabeth pushed the martini away and crossed her arms. It had become her favorite stance lately. Sometimes, she found herself standing in a room alone, with her arms bound so tightly around her own chest that she couldn\u2019t draw an even breath. It was as if she were trying to trap something inside of her that wanted out.\u201cBirdie?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really.\u201dMeghann lowered her voice. \u201cLook. I know something\u2019s wrong, Birdie. I\u2019m your friend. I love you. Talk to me.\u201dThis was why Elizabeth didn\u2019t drink. In such a weakened state, her unhappiness swelled to unmanageable proportions, and the cap she kept on her emotions wouldn\u2019t stay put. She looked across the table at her best friend, and knew she had to say something. She simply couldn\u2019t hold it all inside anymore.Her marriage was failing. Thinking it was hard; saying it was almost unthinkable.They loved each other, she and Jack, but it was a feeling wrought mostly of habit. The passion had been gone for a long time. More and more often, it felt as if they were out of step, dancing to different pieces of music. He wanted sex in the morning; she wanted it at night. They compromised by going months without making love, and when they did finally reach out, their passion was as tired as their need.Still, they were the envy of their friends. Everyone pointed to them and said, Look, a marriage that lasts. She and Jack were like the final exhibit in a museum that had been emptying for years.She couldn\u2019t possibly say all of that. Words had too much power. They had to be handled with fireproof gloves or they\u2019d burn you to the bone. \u201cI\u2019m not very happy lately; that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll sound stupid.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m half drunk. Nothing will sound stupid.\u201dElizabeth wished she could smile at that, but her heart was beating so hard she felt light-headed. \u201cI want . . . who I used to be.\u201d\u201cOh, honey.\u201d Meghann sighed heavily. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve talked to Jack about this.\u201d\u201cEvery time we get close to talking about something that matters, I panic and say nothing\u2019s wrong. Afterward, I want to hit myself in the head with a ball peen hammer.\u201d\u201cI had no idea you were this unhappy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the worst part of it. I\u2019m not unhappy, either.\u201d She slumped forward. Her elbows made the table rattle. \u201cI\u2019m just empty.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re forty-five years old and your kids are gone and your marriage has gone stale and you want to start over. My practice is full of women like you.\u201d\u201cOh, good. I\u2019m not only unhappy and overweight, I\u2019m a clich\u00e9, too.\u201d\u201cA clich\u00e9 is just something that\u2019s commonly true. Do you want to leave him?\u201dElizabeth looked down at her hands, at the diamond ring she\u2019d worn for twenty-four years. She wondered if she could even get it off. \u201cI dream about leaving him. Living alone.\u201d\u201cAnd in those dreams, you\u2019re happy and independent and free. When you wake up, you\u2019re lonely and lost again.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMeghann leaned toward her. \u201cLook, Birdie, women come into my office every day, saying they\u2019re not happy. I write down the words that will tear their families apart and break a lot of hearts. And you know what? Most of them end up wishing they\u2019d tried harder, loved better. They end up trading their homes, their savings, their lifestyle, for a nine-to-five job and a stack of bills, while hubby-dearest waits ten seconds, then marries the salad-bar girl at Hooters. So, here\u2019s a million dollars worth of advice from your best friend and divorce attorney: If you\u2019re empty, it\u2019s not Jack\u2019s fault, or even his problem, and leaving him won\u2019t solve it. It\u2019s your job to make Elizabeth Shore happy.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do that anymore.\u201d\u201cOh, for Christ\u2019s sake, Birdie, let\u2019s be martini-honest here. You used to be a lot of things\u2014talented, independent, artistic, intellectual. In college, we all thought you\u2019d end up being the next Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. Now you organize every city fund-raiser and decorate your house. I got a law degree in less time than it takes you to choose a fabric for the sofa.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not fai\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a lawyer. Fair doesn\u2019t interest me.\u201d Her voice softened. \u201cI also know that Jack\u2019s job has been hard on you. I know how much you wanted a place where you could put down roots.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived in more than a dozen houses since we got married, in almost half that many cities. You\u2019ve lived in Seattle forever. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to always be the stranger in town, the new wife with no friends or r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of your own. Hell, you started college at sixteen and still managed to fit in. I know I\u2019ve let my house become an obsession, but it\u2019s because I belong in Echo Beach, Meg. Finally. For the first time since I was a child, I have a home. Not a house, not a condo, not a place to rent for a year or two. A home.\u201d She realized she was practically yelling. Embarrassed, she lowered her voice. \u201cI feel safe there. You can\u2019t understand that because you\u2019ve never been afraid.\u201dMeghann seemed to consider that. Then she said, \u201cOkay, forget the house. How about this: I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw you paint.\u201dElizabeth drew back. This was something she definitely didn\u2019t want to talk about. \u201cI painted the kitchen last week.\u201d\u201cVery funny.\u201d Meghann fell quiet, waiting for a response.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time after the kids were born.\u201dMeghann\u2019s expression was loving, but steady. \u201cThere is now.\u201dA subtle reminder that the girls were at college now, that Elizabeth\u2019s reason for being had moved on. Only a woman with no children would think it was so easy to begin again. Meg didn\u2019t know what it was like to devote twenty years of your life to children and then watch them walk away. On shows like Oprah, the experts said it left a hole in your life. They underestimated.It was a crater. Where once there had been flowers and trees and life, now nothing but rock remained.Still, she had to admit that the same thought had occurred to her. She\u2019d even tried to sketch a few times, but it was a terrible thing to reach for a talent too late and come up empty-handed. No wonder she\u2019d poured all of her creativity into her beloved house. \u201cIt takes passion to paint. Or maybe just youth.\u201d\u201cTell that to Grandma Moses.\u201d Meghann reached into her handbag and pulled out a small notepad with a pen stuck in the spiral column. She flipped the pad open and wrote some- thing down, then ripped off the piece of paper and handed it to Elizabeth.The note said: Women\u2019s Passion Support Group. Thursday, 7:00/ Astoria Community College.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting almost a year for the right time to recommend this to you.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like a meeting of porn stars. What do they talk about? How to keep your lipstick on during a blow job?\u201d\u201cFunny. Maybe you should try stand-up. And God knows a blow job has saved more than one marriage.\u201d\u201cMeg, I\u2014\u201d\u201cListen to me, Birdie. I have a lot of clients in Grays County, and I send them to this meeting. It\u2019s a group of women\u2014mostly newly divorced\u2014who get together to talk. They\u2019ve all given up too much of themselves, and they\u2019re trying to find a way back.\u201dElizabeth stared down at the note. She knew that Meg was waiting for her to say something, but she couldn\u2019t seem to find her voice. It was one thing to get drunk and complain about her unhappiness to a best friend; it was quite another to walk into a room full of strange women and declare that she had no passion in her life.She hoped her smile didn\u2019t look as brittle as it felt. \u201cThanks, Meg.\u201d Still smiling, she flagged down the waitress and ordered another martini.Echo Beach, OregonThe bedside clock dropped one blocky, red number after another into the darkness. At 6:30\u2014a full thirty minutes early\u2014Jack reached over and disabled the alarm.He lay there, staring at the slats of light sneaking through the louvered blinds. The bedroom was striped in bands of black and white; the horizons of darkness made everything look strangely unfamiliar. He could make out the barest hint of rain falling outside. Another gray, overcast day. Normal early December weather on the Oregon coast.Elizabeth was asleep beside him, her silvery blond hair fanned across the white pillowcase. He could hear the soft, even strains of her breathing, the occasional muffled snore that meant she would probably wake up with a cold. She\u2019d probably caught a bug last week when she\u2019d gone to Seattle.In the earlier days of their marriage, they had always slept nestled together, but somewhere along the way, they\u2019d started needing space between them. Lately, she\u2019d begun sleeping along the mattress\u2019s very edge.But today, things were going to get better. Finally, at forty-six, he was going to get another chance. A Seattle production company was starting a weekly sports program that would cover the highlights of northwest sports; it had been picked up by the NBC affiliate. If he got the anchor job, he\u2019d have to commute three days a week, but with the extra money, that wouldn\u2019t be such a hardship. It was a hell of a step up from the pissant local coverage he\u2019d been doing.(Not where he should be, of course, not where he belonged, but sometimes one mistake could ruin a man.)He\u2019d be someone again.For the last fifteen years, he\u2019d worked his ass off, making progress in steps too small to be seen by the human eye. In a series of shitty little towns, he\u2019d paid for his mistakes. Today, finally, he had a decent opportunity, a chance to get back into the game. There was no way in hell he was going to drop the ball.He got out of bed and immediately winced in pain. This damp climate played hell with his knees. Grimacing, he limped toward the bathroom. As usual, he had to walk over fabric samples and paint chips and open magazines. Birdie had been \u201credoing\u201d their bedroom for months now, planning every move as if she were the defensive coordinator in a Super Bowl game. It was the same story in the dining room. Stuff heaped in every corner, waiting for that rarest of moments: his wife actually making a decision.He had already showered and shaved when Elizabeth stumbled into the room, tightening the thick cotton belt on her bathrobe.\u201cMorning,\u201d she said with a yawn. \u201cGod, I feel like crap. I think I\u2019m getting a cold. You\u2019re up early.\u201dHe felt a flash of disappointment that she\u2019d forgotten. \u201cToday\u2019s the day, Birdie. I\u2019m driving up to Seattle for that interview.\u201dA tiny frown tugged at her brow; then she obviously remembered. \u201cOh, yeah. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get the job.\u201dIn the old days, Birdie would have pumped up his ego, assured him that it would all work out in the end, that he was destined for greatness. But she\u2019d grown tired in the past few years; they both had. And he\u2019d failed to land so many jobs over the years, no wonder she\u2019d stopped believing in him.He\u2019d tried like hell to pretend he was happy here in Ore- gon, that all he wanted out of life was to be the noon sports anchor, covering mostly high-school sports in a midsized market. But Birdie knew he merely tolerated living in this nothing town on the edge of a barely-there city. He even hated being a mid-level celebrity. All it served to do was remind him of who he used to be.She gave him a perfunctory smile. \u201cMore money will be great, especially with the girls in college.\u201d\u201cYou can say that again.\u201dThen she looked up at him. \u201cWill the job make everything better, Jack?\u201dHer question sucked the air from his lungs. God, he was tired of this discussion. Her endless quest for the answer to what\u2019s wrong with our lives was exhausting. Years ago, he\u2019d tried to tell her that all her happiness shouldn\u2019t depend on him. He\u2019d watched as she\u2019d given up more and more of herself. He couldn\u2019t stop it, or didn\u2019t stop it, but somehow it had become all his fault. He was sick to death of it. \u201cNot today, Elizabeth.\u201dShe gave him the sudden, hurt look that he\u2019d come to expect. \u201cOf course. I know it\u2019s a big day for you.\u201d\u201cFor us,\u201d he said, getting angry now.Her smile was too bright to be real. \u201cI picked a place for us to celebrate your new job.\u201dThe sudden change in subject was their way of smoothing over the rough spots in their marriage. He could have stayed angry, forced a discussion, but what was the point? Birdie didn\u2019t fight back and there was nothing new to say. \u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a bear camp in Alaska. A place where you fly in and stay in tents and watch the grizzly bears in their natural environment. I saw an interview with the owner\u2014Laurence John\u2014on the Travel Channel.\u201dHe unwrapped the towel from his waist and slung it haphazardly across the edge of the bathtub. Naked, he turned and headed into the walk-in closet, where he grabbed a pair of underwear, stepped into them, and turned to her. \u201cI thought you were going to say dinner at the Heathman and dancing in the Crystal Ballroom.\u201dShe moved hesitantly toward him. He noticed that she was twisting her wedding ring\u2014a nervous habit from way back. \u201cI thought maybe if we could get away . . . have an adventure . . .\u201dHe knew what she was thinking, and it wouldn\u2019t work. A new location was no more than a different stage upon which to act out the same old scenes, say the same old lines. Still, he touched her face gently, hoping his cynicism didn\u2019t show. There was nothing he hated more than hurting her, although she\u2019d grown so fragile in the past few years that protecting her emotions was an impossible task. \u201cThe bear camp sounds great. Do we get to share a sleep- ing bag?\u201dShe smiled. \u201cThat can be arranged.\u201dHe pulled her against him, holding her close. \u201cMaybe we could celebrate right here in our own bed when I get home.\u201d\u201cI could wear that Victoria\u2019s Secret thing you got me.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be able to concentrate all day.\u201d He kissed her. It was long and sweet, a kiss full of promise. The kind of kiss he\u2019d almost forgotten. For a split second, he remembered how it used to be between them, back in the days when sex was unbelievably good. When spending the day in bed seemed like a perfect idea.As he pulled back from her, he looked down into her beautiful, smiling face. Once, not all that long ago, they\u2019d loved each other unconditionally. He missed those days, those emotions.Maybe.Maybe everything really could change for them today.",

Each transfer is built to last and can withstand up to 20 washer and dryer cycles without cracking or fading. Recommended for use with 100% cotton or polyester/cotton blend fabrics. Avery fabric transfers are the perfect choice whether you need to create custom t-shirts, name labels for clothing, branded tote bags and more. Please Note: Fabric transfers are only compatible with inkjet printers and will are not compatible with laser printers. For best results, feed one sheet at a time."

        "description": [
            "Gingher Knife-edge Dressmaker Shears are meticulously crafted of premium, forged steel with long, precision-ground blades that cut multiple layers of fabric easily, all the way to the tip. The longer cut length makes them the ideal craft scissors for cutting patterns, trimming seams, or cutting long swaths of fabric. The double-plated chrome-over-nickel blade finish is both striking and durable. A bent handle design helps hold fabric flat on your work surface for smooth, comfortable, mistake-free cutting. These Fiskars scissors also include a protective nylon sheath for storage among your other quilting supplies when not in use."

It is permanent on porous surfaces and erasable on most non-porous surfaces. Ideal for beginners and professionals alike, these versatile markers are perfect for arts and crafts, coloring, line drawing, and ornamentation. The marker tips can be rinsed with water to keep them intact, allowing you to dilute, mix, and blend without fear of ruining your marker."

            "Why should I buy the Chandler Tool CT60 Stand up Glue Gun? Once you experience the ease and convenience of our stand-up base, you\u2019ll wonder how you survived without it! No more tipping and no need for an extra glue gun holder. This electronically operated heavy duty glue gun has the power of a jumbo glue gun and will never run out of battery, unlike cordless, wireless, or mini glue guns, making this a great option for professional industrial use in addition to precision detail crafts. Although the CT60 with glue sticks hot glue packs a punch, it is still small and lightweight enough to be a great kid friendly option (with adult supervision). It's perfect for everything from delicate projects like arts and crafts, floral designs, and hair wig making, to electronics work, to home repairs using materials such as PVC, wood, glass, or metal. In addition to being extremely versatile, our hot melt glue gun is the gold standard of glue gun quality. With a body made from top-quality impact-resistant plastic and an all-metal precision heating element, this just might be the last glue gun you buy. A defective glue gun is both an electrical hazard and a fire hazard! Beware CE-certified (Europe-only) & non-certified (yikes!) glue guns. UL-certification is the safety standard for products sold & used in North America. UL certification is very expensive & manufacturers are proud to display it, so if a product doesn\u2019t list it you can be sure it doesn\u2019t have it. Unlike most hot glue guns sold online, the CT60 is fully UL-certified. Who is Chandler Tool? Born out of frustration with low quality throw-away tools, Chandler Tool was founded with a single purpose: to create high quality tools that last a lifetime. Though many of our products are produced overseas, we are an American company, building tools to American standards for American customers. Buy with confidence. We stand by our products with American customer service and a lifetime warranty."

            "Acrylicos Vallejo The Vallejo Company was registered in New Jersey, U.S.A., in the year 1965. In these early years it specialized in the manufacture of colors for animated films (cartoons). The most sustained expansion of Vallejo started in the nineties, beginning with the introduction of new products directed at the Model painting and Hobby sector. The company became the first specialist in acrylic colors, with a long and varied experience in all aspects of this branch of manufacturing. Model Air Paint The formula contains a new acrylic resin with properties until now impossible to obtain in a water based acrylic. The resistance, hardness and covering power of Model Air is superior to any known acrylic for airbrushing. Model Air is presented in a 17 ml. bottle with eyedropper. This packaging prevents the paint from evaporating and drying in the container."

Despite being a normal, healthy child, Anna has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions and injections for the sake of her sister's health. Now, when she must forgo the opportunity to go to a prestigious hockey camp in order to donate a kidney to her sister who has gone into renal failure, Anna decides that enough is enough and sues her parents (Cameron Diaz and Jason Patric) for medical emancipation.

Weeding the excess vinyl - leave the letters/graphics on the sheet with weeding tools. 4. Apply the transfer paper - gently put a transfer paper on the surface of the cut vinyl. Use a scraper over the design and make sure the transfer tape is adhering to the vinyl nice and tight. 5. Adhere it to the new clean and dry flat surface - slowly work with delicate patterns. 6. Remove Transfer paper - rub the clear tape from the center out to adhere the vinyl securely.",

Our professional gessoes usually take just one coat, and adding Liquitex Soft Body color to any gesso creates customized tints and primers. Liquitex BASICS Gesso Surface Prep Medium is a value acrylic gesso used to prepare painting surfaces for acrylic and oil paint. Good quality base coat primer; one coat is usually all that is required. Can be applied to any material or surface that will accept traditional acrylic media, such as canvas, paper, wood, etc. Liquitex Surface Prep Mediums are lightweight, non-toxic, and dry to a water-resistant, non-yellowing surface. APPLICATION: Undiluted or thin up to 25% with water. When thinning more than 25%, use an equal mixture of water and Liquitex Matte Medium to thin gesso."

            "Automatic Colored Machine: Very good color fastness.  Imported Producing Machine: Winding machine purchased from TaiWang; Waxing machine imported from Germany; Drawing setting machine imported from Italy. Excellent Craftsmanship: Very good UV resistance. Secondary lubrication process is using silicon wax imported from Germany to enduce the friction at the end of the needle. Silicon wax has better effects in standing up high temperature, lower breakage rate, less lints and better antistatic effects and so on.",

            "These acrylic paint markers are the modern way to enhance any artist's toolbox. Shaped like a marker, this paint pen is easier to handle than conventional acrylic ink in tubes. The valve system means you can apply paint straight onto the surface and guarantee an even flow. Precise and mess-free to apply, it enables spontaneous creativity. The medium stroke width allows precise control of lines, meaning you can produce a variety of motifs. Endless scope for creativity - from elaborate works of art on canvas to quick sketches on greetings cards. Handy hint: colours can be blended or layered. These acrylic markers also combine well with edding 5200 permanent spray, which can be used to spray the surface of a canvas, for example. Once dry, the spray paint can be drawn over using the acrylic pens. The colours of both product types are beautifully coordinated with each other. Before using for the first time, the marker must be activated as follows: First, shake the marker vigorously with the cap still on, then remove the cap. With the nib facing down, prime the pen on a piece of test paper, carefully pressing down on the paper a few times until ink fills the tip. The marker is now ready for use. The cap can be stored on the end of the marker. Store horizontally and at room temperature (5-30 \u00b0C). High-quality brand product. Made in Germany."

            "Derwent Inktense Pencils are perfect for illustrators, designers, and students. The round, 4mm soft lead core allows for a quick laydown of smooth colour, producing a vibrant finish for bold and expressive drawings. The water soluble pigments can be used for expressive drawings, or mixed with water to create a bright, yet translucent ink-like effect. As the pigment dries quickly, there\u2019s no need to worry about colour bleeding. Perfect for colour layering. Plus, as the colours dry permanently, they are great on fabrics, such as silk or cotton. They can also easily be used on paper. Modify the use to fit your next project. You can create custom shades by mixing colours together, or obtain lighter shades of the same colour by adding water. Mix colours to create a truly unique piece of art. With a heritage dating to 1832, Derwent\u2019s innovation comes from an understanding of artists. We\u2019ve produced a range of quality art materials, many of which are made in our British manufacturing plant."

A weeding tool can be used to remove smaller pieces if needed. (Don't worry if part of the design is peeled off, you can stick it back in the right place because it has an adhesive protective film.) 4: Use an iron (important: turn off the steam) on the t-shirt for 5-10 seconds forth to make the design full.\""

The Home Right Small Spray Shelter provides an area to spray paint quickly and easily while limiting the overspray drift on other items in your project area. The spray shelter also has straps for adding an optional fan and filter (not included). Increase control by adding a standard 20\u201d window box fan and a 20\u201d x 20\u201d MERV filter (level 8 or greater). This optional feature is great for drawing airflow towards the back of the shelter and capturing paint overspray. COLORS OF SHELTER MAY VARY."

            "What is Sugru Moldable Glue?",
            "Say Hello to Sugru by tesa! The moldable glue turns into a durable and flexible silicone rubber. Thanks to its Advanced Silicone Technology, Sugru sticks to lots of different materials.",
            "This is how Sugru Moldable Glue works:",
            "Out of the pack, Sugru is soft and malleable, just like play-dough. Roll the material in your fingers, press it where you need it, and mold it into any shape. You have 30 minutes to repair, bond, seal, mount, modify, create, decorate, improve, upcycle, even personalize \u2013 enough time to reposition and make perfect. If you change your mind? You can remove Sugru from non-porous surfaces by using a knife or scalpel.",
            "What can Sugru be used for?",
            "There are no limits to what you can do with this versatile easy to use repair putty. Sugru is the best glue for tool-free, everyday fixing, including like-new invisible repairs, handicrafts, and DIY projects.You can use Sugru to fix frayed charger cables* and broken zippers, re-attach and rebuild missing parts on things like pot lids, cutlery, or toys. You can also make stuff scratch-proof, like making protective rubber feet for chairs or restore the seals on fridges or dishwashers. Thanks to the non-toxic, mess-free material you can also use Sugru together with your children over the age of three.But that\u2019s not all: Thanks to its robust UV and rain/humidity resistance, Sugru is perfect for making improvements around the house, indoors and outdoors. Whether it\u2019s for fixing and making in the garden or sealing leaky hiking boots, Sugru scores with its weatherproof and waterproof features. It can also withstand challenging indoor environments like wet bathrooms or kitchen sink areas. Sugru is temperature-resistant and extremely strong too, one single-use pack can hold up to 4.4lb**, making it ideal for mounting without drilling. When do you start your project?*Be careful with electricity. Stick to small consumer electronics repairs, low current and below 24 volts.**Depending on the thickness of the application, for load-bearing projects, allow up to 48 hours for Sugru to fully set."

Scrapbook enthusiasts and crafters require its archival quality for preserving memories in journals, and for making cards, quilts and dolls. Use Pigma Micron to leave a mark that will last a lifetime. Pigma ink, invented by Sakura over 25 years ago, continues to be the most reliable permanent ink on the market today. Artists, consumers, the government, and scientists consider Pigma Micron a necessary basic tool for any archival-quality, handwritten project."

            "Liquitex offers the broadest range of acrylic mediums to inspire creativity at every stage of the painting process. Surface Prep Mediums are used to seal prime and add tooth (for color adhesion) to all surfaces such as canvas wood paper and metal. This same preparation is used for both acrylic and oil paint. Our professional gessoes usually take just one coat and adding Liquitex Soft Body color to any gesso creates customized tints and primers. Liquitex Colored Gesso Surface Prep Medium are premium acrylic gessos used to prepare painting surfaces for acrylic and oil paint. Using pre-mixed gesso is more convenient than tinting clear gesso. Priming a canvas in black or neutral grey eliminates the starkness of white and provides strong contrast. Excellent base coat primer for many applications, including murals;\u00a0one coat is usually all that is required. Can be applied to any material or surface that will accept traditional acrylic media, such as canvas, paper, wood, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Liquitex Surface Prep Mediums are lightweight, non-toxic and dry to a water-resistant, non-yellowing surface. APPLICATION: Use undiluted or thin up to 25% with water.\u00a0 When thinning more than 25%, use an equal mixture of water and Liquitex Matte Medium to thin gesso. Tint color with Liquitex Soft or Heavy Body Artist Colors. Visit our Liquitex Amazon Storefront for full product assortment."

            "Almost everyone has a Duck Tape story to tell, usually praising its remarkable strength and versatility. Duck Brand duct tape has a wide range of applications, both traditional and nontraditional, and is now available in dozens of colors and patterns, making it even more useful than ever! Because of its strength and adhesive properties, you can use Color Duck Tape for almost any job, including everyday household and auto repairs--anywhere a flexible and weather-proof bond is needed. Great for temporary indoor floor marking and removes cleanly from most surfaces up to 3 weeks. Not recommended for hardwood floors or in direct sunlight. Color Duck Tape is great for coordinating materials, color-coding and identification, craft applications, and more. This heavy duty tape is cotton mesh reinforced, but still easy to tear! Duck Tape conforms to both smooth and uneven surfaces, and can be used on materials such as cloth, vinyl, leather and plastic - even metal and laminates. Duck Tape is great for any repairs - anywhere!"

Available in 15 different colours, from brightly coloured to classic black. A wide range of colours that bring joy and allow any idea to be colourfully engraved on porcelain, glass and ceramic. The odour-free, water-based ink is quick-drying and particularly lightfast. Before using the oven, decorations and lettering can be easily corrected without leaking. The high quality tip ensures an even ink distribution without squeezing and without dripping. This makes it ideal for beginners as well as advanced painters. Before painting, clean the surface carefully (e.g. dishwasher and methylated alcohol) and make sure the surface is absolutely fingerprint free. Then let the creative artwork dry for 15 minutes and then insert into the oven at 160 \u00b0C for 25 minutes. Then let cool down. High quality branded product. Made in Germany."

Continue to flat the cloth to ensure there are no pleats, and pay attention to fabric to make the warp and the welt both vertical and horizontal, and finally tighten the screws.  4. Inspect the hoop whether it is tight enough. The way to check the tightness is to use a needle with thread going through the fabric surface. It is workable if there is a bang bang sound when pulling the thread.",

Repeat this step with one cap and one stud where you plan to install the other side of your snap. 5. Squeeze together a cap+socket AND THEN a cap+stud. 6. Once you have each side of your snap installed, the socket and stud will click together! If either side feels loose, simply set the one side of the snap in the pliers again and squeeze.",

What is die cutting? Die cutting is a quick and easy way of producing individual, or mass shapes from paper, foil, cardstock or even chipboard using a machine and die, instead of cutting by hand. What cuts my material? A die cutting machine will always be necessary in order to die cut, though it's not the machine itself that physically cuts your material. The die cutter you use (for example a Sizzix Bigz, Thinlits or Framelits die), is responsible for revealing your design. the machine just applies the pressure. So if you're ever unsure whether you can die cut a certain material, check the compatibility of your die rather than your machine",

            "HeatnBond SpraynBond Quilt Basting Adhesive Fabric Spray, 7.2 OZ (204g) is a temporary bond spray adhesive for fabric. Use it in your design phase for pattern piecing and determining applique placement. Great for holding templates onto fabric and assembling landscape quilts. Use it while sewing to eliminate pinning of appliques and hoop marks. Perfect for holding stabilizers onto fabrics during embroidery or holding backing fabric to batting. General Directions: Hold can upright, 12 inches from back of fabric surface. Press nozzle and apply adhesive to back of fabric surface in a sweeping (side to side) motion to lightly and evenly coat surface, making sure to cover all edges. Wait 30 seconds, then press sprayed item onto project while still tacky, repositioning as needed. Before storing, hold can upside down and press for a short burst to clear nozzle.Tips for best results: A little goes a long way; remember to apply a light coating from 12 inches away. When spraying on or near project, protect your project and workspace from any over-spray. Clean off work surface with soap and water, but please note that heavier applications may be difficult to remove from some surfaces."

Indelible and impervious to water, Pinata Colors clean up with alcohol and re-wet themselves, allowing for unique effects and techniques not easily achieved with water-based inks. Only the most lightfast dyes have been selected for the palette, and special formulary technology allows more color into each bottle. Possibly most impressive is the Pinata Colors opens up for non-porous surfaces. By easily re-wetting with alcohol, blowing the color across the surface with air, moving the surface by hand, pouring, or applying with a paint brush, you can achieve incredible effects. Acid-free and with excellent adhesive properties, Pinata colors are the go-to inks. Conforms to ASTM D4236. Made in the USA."

Deco Poly Mesh is an incredibly versatile material for decorating, wrapping and more. It's inexpensive, it's reusable, and it's weather resistant. It's perfect for decorating indoors or outdoors, although some fading may occur over long periods of direct sun exposure. Our deco mesh is of the highest quality, and holds its shape beautifully. Whether you're making a wreath, a garland, or a bow, the beautifully full ruffles, curls and poofs that you fix into your design will stay that way. You'll find the edges on our mesh to be clean, so you won't have any loose threads hanging on your creations. These 10-inch wide rolls of Deco Poly Mesh are great for various decorating projects where you don't need the full width and body of the 21-inch version. This width is great for making bows, wreaths, garlands and more. One popular wreath-making technique using ten-inch mesh is the \"Ruffle\" method"
