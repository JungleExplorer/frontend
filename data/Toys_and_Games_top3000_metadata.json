As soon as a player reaches 100 points or more the player with the fewest points wins. Collecting the fewest points means to look for low or even negative numbers. Further excitement is added by several special rules, which for example make it possible to remove several cards (and with it points) from the game \u2013 this can lead to unexpected turns. This motivates daring decisions that might even come back to bite, if the other players can counter faster than expected.",
            "What is needed to play? Enough space for 12 cards in front of each player. A positive side effect: When playing, your hands are free, so you can count points or eat snacks. As the game rules are quite easy, small talk during your turns is no problem.",

            "There\u2019s only one Original Slinky Brand! Celebrate 75 years of wiggly-jiggly fun with Slinky! Generations of children and adults have loved playing with Slinky. This classic metal spring toy walks downstairs, alone or in pairs, and makes a slink-ity sound. First invented by mechanical engineer Richard James in 1943 during an experiment with tension coils. James accidentally dropped a spring on the floor and watched as it began to \u201cwalk.\u201d Two years later, he introduced his walking spring toy in Gimbels Department Store during Christmas, and the Slinky immediately sold out. Since its debut, over 300 million Slinkys have been sold worldwide. In 2000, this classic toy was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame. Made 75 years ago, Slinky continues to be a favorite toy of children and adults all over the world. Slinky is fun for a girl or a boy and makes an ideal gift, stocking stuffer, prize, or present. Everyone loves a Slinky! Ages 5+"

And when you\u2019re down to one card, don\u2019t forget to shout \u201cUNO!\u201d The first player to rid themselves of all the cards in their hand before their opponents wins.

            "Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries.",

Their teammates know the agents only by their codenames. The teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents first. Spymasters give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the table. Their teammates try to guess words of their color while avoiding those that belong to the opposing team. And everyone wants to avoid the assassin. The game works very well with 4 players if you prefer to guess without help. Or you can add more players if you prefer lively discussion. There is also a cooperative variant where a single team tries to achieve the highest score they can by playing against the game itself."

            "Codenames is a social word game with a simple premise and challenging game play. Two rival spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their codenames. The teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents first. Spymasters give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the table. Their teammates try to guess words of their color while avoiding those that belong to the opposing team. And everyone wants to avoid the assassin. The game works very well with 4 players if you prefer to guess without help. Or you can add more players if you prefer lively discussion. There is also a cooperative variant where a single team tries to achieve the highest score they can by playing against the game itself."

It can be difficult to get baby's bath temperature just right, but our White Hot Safety Bath Ducky helps prevent unnecessary bath time burns. Our take on the classic rubber duck has a disc that reads \"HOT\" when the water is unsuitable for baby's sensitive skin. It also floats, and is easy for baby to grasp - making it a must for both safety and fun. Dive into wonder with the scuba swimming bath toy, which is beloved by babies and toddlers alike, and the little boat train, which links, stacks, floats and pours water too.

How many routes can you take and also foil your opponents? Try to gain the advantage by inserting the extra tile to move walls and open passages of the labyrinth. Block and advance is the strategy! The first play to reach all of their treasure wins!",

            "The aMAZEing Labyrinth uses a clever board design to create a series of ever-changing mazes that one to four players must move through. The object of the game is for each player to collect as quickly as possible all seven treasures depicted on their individual treasure cards. To add to the challenge, players know what the next treasure is only after they find the one before it. Before each turn, a maze card is pushed into the maze in a strategic place, helping the player make his or her way to the prize. This means that the entire maze shifts and changes on each turn, confounding some and helping others. Players will need to think ahead to choose just the right spot to shift the maze in their favor. This is an excellent game to get lost in. A simpler version can be played by younger children.",

Hitch the camper to the convertible car to travel, and unhitch when it's time to camp. Then open the camper to reveal a kitchen with sink, stove and fridge (with a working door!) and two bunk beds (with a ladder!) so there's always room for a friend. There's even a doggie door so her pet puppy can come and go. More than 10 toy pieces inspire imaginations to tell all kinds of camping stories, including camp songs -- there's a firepit, a guitar, two stools and two sticks with marshmallows for classic camping moments, plus two drinks, a pot, a towel and a suitcase. Pack it all up when it's time to move on -- there's lots of places to stow stuff while on the go, including the trunk of the car! Chelsea doll is ready to see the world in a bright yellow top with \"happy camper\" graphic, a blue skirt with white polka dots and pink shoes; her puppy has an adorable expression that's happy, too! Kids will love exploring the world with this playset. Collect other Club Chelsea dolls and toys for even more possibilities for playtime (each sold separately, subject to availability). Includes Chelsea doll wearing skirt and shoes, puppy, car, camper, guitar, fire pit, two stools, two sticks with marshmallows, two drinks, one pot, one towel, one blanket and one suitcase.

            "The Write and Learn Creative Center by VTech provides children with an interactive and fun way to give them a head start on writing. Animated demonstrations on the toddler drawing pad teach kids proper stroke order for uppercase and lowercase letters. Or, customize the creative center with your child\u2019s name and the screen will show them how to write it step-by-step. Trace along behind the instructions to improve listening & response skills. Choose a drawing activity and your child will learn to draw by progressing from simple lines and shapes to various complex objects, using the magnetic tracing board to capture abstract ideas along the way. Your little artist can explore their creativity by drawing their own pictures with the included stencils and stamps while listening to the cheerful music. Requires 2 AA batteries (batteries included for demo purposes only; new batteries recommended for regular use). Designed for kids ages 3 to 6 years old. Frustration Free Packaging means it comes in an easier to open, plain brown box."

            "When young imaginations open the door to the Barbie Dreamhouse, they'll discover unlimited storytelling possibilities! Standing 43 inches tall and 41 inches wide, this dreamy dollhouse inspires 360-degree play with three floors and 10 indoor and outdoor living areas. Move right in and customize the space -- the grass area and pool can be placed in multiple configurations on the first and third floors, and the slide fits in four second-floor locations. After designing the layout, set the scene for any story with three songs, two soundscapes and customizable light settings! Then, double the fun with transforming furniture -- the BBQ grill reverses to reveal a dessert buffet, the entertainment center reverses to reveal a pet play area, and a bunk bed folds down from the wall. Kids can play out any story, from an ordinary day to the ultimate get-together with a kitchen, living room, dining room, bedroom, bathroom, pool, balcony, party room and more. Lift and lower Barbie doll and her friends in the working elevator, fill the pool with water to make a splash, soak up some sun on the third-floor balcony and rooftop deck, and host a pet playdate with a puppy pool and slide. Storytelling accessories -- over 75 of them! -- feature realistic touches and textures that bring any Barbie story to life. With cool customizations and so many storytelling opportunities, kids ages 3 years old and up will move right into the Barbie Dreamhouse and make it their own! Assembly required. Dolls, vehicle and wheelchair not included. Requires 3 AA (LR6) alkaline batteries (not included). Colors and decorations may vary."

With enough practice, you and your Pixie are on your way to becoming the best air dancers in Hatchtopia! Mid-flight, you can safely grab your Pixie\u2019s legs to reposition her. Made of durable and safety tested materials, if you accidentally touch her wings while she\u2019s flying, it\u2019s completely safe \u2013 with an auto-stop feature, she\u2019ll stop flying right away. When she\u2019s not flying, display your Pixie inside her sparkly clear crystal egg!

Designed in signature pink with rolling wheels, this camper opens to reveal so much more! Simply press the button at the top of the vehicle to activate a magical feature: the side panel opens, the top pops up and the front and back of the camper expand to create a play space more than 2 feet long! The open side becomes a pool with a water slide and stairs that fold out. The interior offers dining under the stars -- set up the dining table and front vehicle seats that become two chairs. The back of the camper holds a closet and bathroom with sink, shower and toilet on one side -- on the other side is a kitchen with sink, a refrigerator and a surprise fold-out table! DreamCamper also includes a fire pit and marshmallows roasting on sticks which allow for bonding moments. And two hammocks and two sleeping spaces mean four dolls can enjoy sweet dreams. When morning comes and it's time to move, close up the camper and roll to the next adventure. Cool details, like pink wheels, a moving steering wheel, silvery accents, a colorful stripe and open windows, make camping fun. Lots of accessories add to the storytelling play. Young adventurers will love hitting the open road with the Barbie DreamCamper and stopping wherever imagination leads because with Barbie, you can be anything! Includes camper play set with transformation features that include a pop-out pool (with ladder and stairs), pop-out rear (with bathroom and kitchen features), two hammocks and front seats that double as chairs; furnishings that include a dining table, two stools and a fire pit; and storytelling accessories, like four sticks with marshmallows, place settings, food, pillows and blankets for sleeping; dolls not included.

            "When kids hit the open road in the Barbie 3-in-1 DreamCamper, their stories can go wherever their imaginations lead! Multiple transformations and hidden surprises make playtime exciting -- give the bright pink camper a push to get the fun rolling. When it's time to explore, unlatch the front of the camper to reveal a pickup truck that seats four. Peek underneath the backseat of the truck to find a boat that's perfect for a fishing trip! When imaginations are ready to set up camp, open the side panels to transform this camping RV to a camping playset with room for four dolls to eat, sleep and play. One side folds down to reveal a pool and the other creates a cool, open-air kitchen space that inspires cooking fun. Between the two is a living room area for lounging, complete with graphics that add signature style and make Barbie doll feel right at home. Finally, open the back panel to reveal a bathroom with a pop-up shower, toilet and vanity. Multiple play areas tell so many different stories! After a long day of exploration and play, send Barbie doll and her sisters or friends up to the roof -- pull out the loft bed for Chelsea or another small doll -- where they can sleep under the stars. When they're ready to move on to their next adventure, pack everything inside and close it up to hit the road again. A fun design with realistic details and cool graphics makes road tripping so much fun! With 60 play pieces, the opportunities for storytelling are endless. It's easy to play out travel stories and outdoor adventures with the Barbie 3-in-1 DreamCamper because with Barbie, you can be anything! Add even more variety to playtime by expanding the Barbie world with dolls and accessories (each sold separately, subject to availability). Dolls not included. Colors and decorations may vary."

Stringing the easily grasped beads promotes hand-eye coordination as well as fine motor, cognitive, and visual perception skills. This Melissa & Doug beads and laces set allows adults and children to explore multiple playing activities. Parents can ask their child to sort the beads by color, identify each color of bead for the child, and repeat the activity until the child can identify all of the colors independently. Parents can also encourage kids to develop counting skills by asking their child to count the number of beads in each color along with them, repeating the activity until the child has mastered counting one group of beads. The Primary Lacing Beads set makes an exceptional gift for kids from 3 to 5 years.

            "Thirty wooden beads in six vibrant colors and five distinct shapes combine with two extra-long laces to kick off many creative activities. Stringing the easily grasped beads promotes hand-eye coordination as well as fine motor, cognitive, and visual perception skills. This Melissa & Doug beads and laces set allows adults and children to explore multiple playing activities. Parents can ask their child to sort the beads by color, identify each color of bead for the child, and repeat the activity until the child can identify all of the colors independently. Parents can also encourage kids to develop counting skills by asking their child to count the number of beads in each color along with them, repeating the activity until the child has mastered counting one group of beads. The Primary Lacing Beads set makes an exceptional gift for kids from 3 to 5 years. Add the Melissa & Doug Lace & Trace activity set to round out the hands-on play experience and give kids another engaging option for screen-free fun.

            "LEGO Chain Reactions is packed full of ideas, instructions, and inspiration for 10 LEGO machines that spin, swing, pivot, roll, lift, and drop. Each machine alone is awesome, but put them together and you get incredible chain reactions. Then, combine the machines in any order you like to create your own chain reactions. Our team of experts worked with educators and 11-year-olds to invent the machines, then wrote a book that teaches the skills (and some of the physics behind the fun) kids need to create their own amazing chain reaction machines.Our book includes 33 special LEGO elements that combine with basic bricks from your collection to make your machines go. But don\u2019t worry that you won\u2019t have the right bricks; we worked with the folks at LEGO to make sure you\u2019ll need only the most common bricks, and that there are plenty of substitutes. The result is a chain reaction of fun, as one thing leads to another\u2026 and another\u2026 and another.Comes with: 78 page book, 33 LEGO elements, 6 LEGO balls, 6 feet of string, 8 paper ramps, 2 paper pop-up signs, 1 paper funnel ramp, 1 paper flag, 1 paper bucket, 1 platform",

The Scientist needs only 4 cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal 5. But the diseases are out breaking fast and time is running out: the team must try to stem the tide of infection in diseased areas while also towards cures. A truly cooperative game where you all win or you all lose."

This creative and practical activity pad gives an engaging, creative direction to scissor work, meaning more concentration and less mess. Organized from simpler to more complex, 20 different paper-cutting projects (with complete supplies included right in the pages of the book) allow children to practice slightly different skills and techniques and produce 20 distinct crafts, games, and activities that offer them a creative focus and a sense of accomplishment. Plastic safety scissors are included, which naturally encourage proper form and are safe for preschoolers\u2014but any pair of scissors can be used to complete the paper-cutting projects. The included safety scissors are child-safe, easy to use, and can be used by right- or left-handed kids. Our scissor skills activity set for kids assists in the development of fine motor skills and cognitive skills. The inclusion of mazes, puzzles, animal art, sequencing activities, and much more stimulates creativity. This child-safe scissors activity set is a great gift for kids ages 4 to 7.

But be careful, after any given push of the plunger, the poop may COME FLYING OUT OF THE TOILET! The first player to grab the poop earns a token. If a player is quick enough to catch it in midair, they earn two tokens. The player who ends up with the most tokens wins! Is this game really gross or just gross enough? You decide! Lots of silly fun for 2 to 4 young plungers, age 5 years and older. Comes with 1 toilet, 1 plunger, 1 die and 10 score tokens. Colors and decorations may vary."

            "Exploding kittens is a card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats. In this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an exploding kitten, at which point They explode, they are Dead, and they are out of the game -- unless that player has a defuse card, which can defuse the kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the exploding kittens. This nsfw version of the game contains the full version of exploding kittens, but the artwork on each card has been replaced with content too horrible/amazing to be used in the original exploding kittens game. The nsfw edition can be played with 2 to 5 players or combined with another deck to play with up to 9 players."

Position ships strategically to survive opponent's relentless strikes, and track hits and misses with red and white pegs on the ocean grid.

            "Product Description",
            "A beloved classic toy gets an exciting new twist with this deluxe pounding bench. As the colorful, non-removable pegs on the bench go up and down, they play peekaboo, taking turns showing their friendly smiles while the child has fun practicing fine motor skills. And you\u2019ll enjoy that because the pegs are attached, they can\u2019t get lost. A sturdy wooden mallet is included. Children delight in striking a peg with the mallet and watching one on the opposite side pop up. Once kids have seen this cause-and-effect in action, they will enjoy predicting which peg will pop up next. As they develop hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills, they will also be learning numbers and colors by counting the pegs and naming each color as it pops up. The Melissa & Doug Deluxe Pounding Bench Wooden Toy makes a great gift for kids 2 to 4 years. This product measures 5.25\" H x 10\" L x 5\" W and includes a sturdy wooden mallet. Add the Melissa & Doug Wooden Latches Board to round out the developmental play and learning experience. For more than 30 years, Melissa & Doug has created beautifully designed imagination- and creativity-sparking products that NBC News called \u201cthe gold standard in early childhood play.\u201d Today, Melissa & Doug is proudly partnering with the American Academy of Pediatrics to foster early brain development and help children build important life skills through play.",

            "Phase 10 is the rummy-type card game from the makers of UNO with a challenging and exciting twist! And this version of Phase 10 comes in a decorative tin that's great for storage and ships in its own container. The object of the game is to be the first player to complete 10 varied phases with two sets of three, one run of seven, or seven cards with the same color. The twist is that each Phase to be completed is specific for each hand dealt. Players who complete one Phase advance to the next, but those who don't must keep trying until they do. Each deck features 'Wild' and Skip' cards, which add excitement and can help you get out of a sticky situation. A 'Wild' card can be used in place of a number card, as well as be used as any color to complete any phase, while a 'Skip' card causes your opponent to lose a turn! Be the first person to complete all ten phases to win the game. Includes 108 cards, instructions and tin. Colors and decorations may vary."

            "Get ready for fast-paced play with lights and sounds that challenge players with every sequence. To beat the Simon game, players need to remember the color pattern and repeat it by pressing the colored buttons on the game unit in the correct order. It starts off at a rather steady pace, but the more you play, the more complicated the patterns become, building suspense with each turn. Count 1 point each time the green light flashes, and 10 points when all the lights flash at once. The Simon game unit helps keep track of the highest score as players challenge friends or try to beat their own high score in solo play. Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro."

More than 3 feet tall and 4 feet wide, the Barbie Dreamhouse has so many amazing features -three stories, eight rooms that include a carport (car not included) and a home office, a working elevator that fits four dolls, a pool that has a slide descending from the story above, five pieces of transforming furniture, lights, sounds and more than 60 additional accessories, including an adorable puppy, that can all be used to decorate, set the scene and play out so many stories. Plug-and-play design helps keep pieces in place as small hands move around (and make clean up easy for adult hands!). Decorations and furniture for indoor and outdoor settings inspire play from all angles, and the transformations provide two-in-one fun while encouraging flexible action -the couch turns into bunk beds, the coffee table flips for a bed sized for Chelsea doll (sold separately), the fireplace becomes a home office, the refrigerator turns into an outdoor food stand and the oven houses a barbecue in back. Lights and sounds add even more delightful touches -the oven lights up and the timer ticks, the stovetop sizzles with the frying pan and whistles with the tea kettle and the toilet makes a flushing sound. Young decorators will have so much fun moving accessories around the house as they explore their personal style and tell all kinds of stories, from daytime to nighttime, indoor to outdoor, Barbie home alone or with a house full of friends and family (dolls sold separately). Pool parties, friend sleepovers, sister bonding, backyard BBQs, birthday, holidays and every day\u00a0 there are endless stories to tell and limitless ways to explore living in the Barbie Dreamhouse because with Barbie, anything is possible. Includes Barbie Dreamhouse and 70 accessories that include furniture, household items and a puppy; dolls, fashions and car not included. Colors and decorations may vary."

Waiting for their families to bring them home, these patient elves hibernate until their family reads The Elf on the Shelf, gives their elf a very special name, and registers their adoption online. Once named, each scout elf will receive its Christmas magic and becomes part of the family's Christmas each and every year.",

            "Scout elves are eyes and ears of Santa Claus",
            "Although they cannot be touched, or else they may lose their magic, the elf will always listen and relay messages back to Santa. Taking in all the day-to-day activities around the house, no good deed goes unnoticed; these scout elves take their job seriously.",
            "Before the family awakes each morning, their special scout elf will fly back to their home from the North Pole. However, since these elves like to play games, don't expect to find them in the same spot! While some like to hide in the freezer (probably because it reminds them of the North Pole) and others prefer to sit on the fireplace mantle or hang from the chandelier, these elves love to play hide-and-seek with their families.",
            "From the Manufacturer",
            "Year after year, children and adults alike are baffled by the mystery of how Santa really knows who\u2019s been naughty or nice. After much urging by the elves and Mrs. Claus, Santa has allowed his biggest secret to be revealed in The Elf on the Shelf: A Christmas Tradition. At the start of each Christmas season, the elf appears to serve as Santa's eyes and ears, traveling back to the North Pole each and every night to make a detailed report of the day\u2019s activities. This keepsake gift set includes a light skin, blue eyed boy North Pole pixie scout elf and a hardbound watercolor picture book. Children can register their elf online to receive an official adoption certificate and a special letter from Santa.",

            "Product Description",
            "It will be love at first sight when this adorable, soft-bodied baby doll comes home, At 12 inches long, Jenna is an ideal size for toddlers 18 months and older to hug, cuddle, and care for. She has molded plastic hair and wipe-clean arms, legs, and face. Jenna closes her bright blue eyes as she is rocked to sleep and when she lies down and opens them when she is picked up. Young mommies and daddies can comfort Jenna by helping her to suck her thumb or the included pacifier. Her beautifully stitched pink romper and matching infant bonnet are removable. Quality craftsmanship ensures endless hours of pretend play and a baby doll that will remain a favorite for years to come. Jenna is a great baby doll to help toddlers express themselves and to encourage imaginative play. Doll play develops cognitive and fine motor skills as children practice removing and putting on clothing, helping her to suck her thumb and pacifier, and moving her arms and legs. Children learn language skills as they talk to Jenna and caring for their baby doll helps foster nurturing skills and responsibility. Doll play also helps self-esteem and confidence grow by leaps and bounds. Jenna is just waiting for a child to call her \u201cMine to Love\u201d, For more than 30 years, Melissa & Doug has created beautifully designed imagination- and creativity-sparking products that NBC News called \u201cthe gold standard in early childhood play.\u201d Today, Melissa & Doug is proudly partnering with the American Academy of Pediatrics to foster early brain development and help children build important life skills through play.",

            "This Battleship board game is the classic game of naval combat that brings together competition, strategy, and excitement! In head-to-head battle, 2 players search for the enemy's fleet of ships and destroys them one by one. With convenient portable battle cases and realistic looking naval crafts, the Battleship game puts players right in the middle of the action. Players command a powerful fleet that includes an aircraft carrier, a destroyer, a submarine, a patrol boat, and a battleship. Each player announces the coordinates of each strike and sees if it hits. Position ships strategically to survive an opponent's relentless strikes, and track hits and misses with red and white pegs on the ocean grid. No ship is safe in this game of stealth and suspense. Kids ages 7 and up can enjoy playing the Battleship classic board game. It's a great indoor activity. Packaging may vary. Subject to availability. Battleship and all related characters are trademarks of Hasbro.",

With the LeapFrog learning lights remote, little ones can press up, down, left or right to hear counting and numbers songs, play a shapes game with the delightful puppy pal Scout, or Count along with him. They can press the channel buttons to hear how Scout has fun in all kinds of weather or to help him Count shapes in his garden. The number buttons prompt a counting activity, which encourages little ones to Count bright-colored shapes that light up on the screen. Lovable Scout is always at their fingertips to entertain, encourage and help children explore. The light-up remote comes with 3 AAA batteries, which should be replaced for home use."

            "Talk about a classic childhood toy! All the colors of the rainbow are represented by these 8 smooth, easy-to-grasp wooden pieces. Stack them on the solid-wood base, designed with rocking edges for safe and engaging play. This wooden stacker toy is made from durable and child-safe materials, which delivers exceptional quality and value, making it a top seller and a childhood favorite. The Melissa & Doug ring stacker features brightly colored and smoothly sanded pieces that help children build early shape, color, and size-differentiation abilities. The Melissa & Doug Rainbow Stacker Classic Toy makes an exceptional gift for kids 18 months and up. Add the Melissa & Doug Shape-Sorting Cube to round out the hands-on, screen-free play experience. Grown-ups can help their youngsters develop strong skills by playing several games, such as removing the stacking pieces from the rods and placing them on a flat surface, then helping kids name the colors of the pieces. When they are familiar with all the colors, have them sort the pieces by color and count the pieces in each group. Additionally, mix all the pieces together and have kids sort them according to shape. This toddler stacker toy makes an exceptional gift for kids from 2 to 4 years. Add the Shape-Sorting Cube to round out the hands-on, screen-free play experience. For more than 30 years, Melissa & Doug has created beautifully designed imagination- and creativity-sparking products that NBC News called \u201cthe gold standard in early childhood play.\u201d Today, Melissa & Doug is proudly partnering with the American Academy of Pediatrics to foster early brain development and help children build important life skills through play.",

The translucent tube stands upright on a base that contains four separate numbered trays. Each player selects a numbered compartment to use throughout the game, and the straws are passed through holes midway of the tube to form a lattice 'web.\u201d The marbles are then placed in the top of the tube and held in place by the web. Just set it up, start playing and watch out for marbles that go \u201cKer Plunk!\u201d The players must use steady hands and a cool head to remove the sticks from below the marbles. This best game from yester-year is just as much fun today! Share your great memories or start new ones! You and your friends will have a blast playing Ker Plunk!, just don\u2019t let the marbles fall! For 2 to 4 players."

            "Product Description",
            "SCORE! HOLE IN ONE! Play Nine, the Card Game of Golf, is a fun and exciting twist on the classic game of golf. Just like the actual game, the person with the lowest score wins! Perfect for family game night, reunions, holiday parties, or as a down time activity, Play Nine is just the thing to keep everyone entertained and having a ball. Game play: Players are dealt 8 game cards each with a discard pile as well as a draw pile at the center of the table. Players then without looking separate their 8 cards into 2 rows of 4. They each then flip two cards over. Moving forward each player has an option whether to replace one of their flipped or face down cards with a card from the draw pile or the discard pile. If they do not like the card from either the draw pile or the discard pile, the player may choose to flip one of their face down cards for their turn. Play continues until a player has one card left. At this point, everyone has one hand left until the end of the game. When someone has all 8 cards shown players tally up their totals at the top of the cards and record them into the score card. That was round one! Full point details and further game direction can be found in the Play Nine Instructions included. For 2-6 Players. Recommended for ages 8+. Includes 2 decks of premium Play Nine cards (108 Cards), easy to follow game instructions, scorecards, and a pencil. Play time: 15-20 min.",
            "From the Manufacturer",
            "Play Nine is a golf themed card game where the goal is to shoot the lowest score. Draw, flip and discard card values range from -5 (hole-in-one) to 12 (out of bounds). The combination of strategy and luck-of-the-draw keeps the fun and challenge alive down to the last hole."

            "Product Description",
            "Mancala is one of the world's oldest and best-loved games, and Pressman's folding wooden Mancala board offers an affordable way to play that makes a great travel game as well as a wonderful home edition. Players take turns scooping up the special stones and counting them out one at a time into the pockets on the board. When they drop a stone into an empty pocket on their side of the board, they capture all the stones in the opposite pocket. It sounds like a simple marble game, but it's got plenty of strategy and reinforces STEM skills like counting and strategic planning. The winner is the player who collects the most stones! This folding Mancala includes a hinged wooden playing board, 48 plastic stones, and complete instructions.",
            "From the Manufacturer",
            "Mancala is thousands of years old, tracing its lineage to ancient Egypt. Legend has it that workers played the game during rest periods while building the pyramids. But the game is great for modern times as well--it has gained new popularity as one of the world's most intriguing and clever two-player games. To start, place all the stones in the pockets of the board. When it's your turn, choose a pocket and scoop up all the stones in it, then drop them back into the pockets one-by-one as you circle the board. With just a few easy rules to follow, the object is to collect the most by the end of the game. All the pieces go back inside the game unit for easy storage. This set includes: 1 high quality wood hinged playing board, 48 plastic stones and complete instructions."

            "Introducing a modern banking version of the Monopoly game: the Ultimate Banking Edition. In this edition, Monopoly money is no more! The Monopoly Ultimate Banking game features an all-in-one Ultimate Banking unit with touch technology that makes the game fast and fun. Now players can instantly buy properties, set rent, and tap their way to fortune. Each player gets a bankcard and the Ultimate Banking unit keeps track of everyone's fortunes. It also scans the game's property cards and can boost or crash the market. Traditional Monopoly play gets amped up with this edition -- the game introduces Event cards and Location spaces instead of Chance cards and Community Chest cards. Land on an Event Space, and rents may be raised or lowered, a player may earn or lose money, or someone could get sent to Jail. Location Spaces allow players to pay and move to any property space on the gameboard. Challenge friends and family to win it all with the Monopoly Ultimate Banking game! The Hasbro Gaming and Monopoly names and logos, the distinctive design of the gameboard, the four corner squares, the Mr. Monopoly name and character, as well as each of the distinctive elements of the board and playing pieces are trademarks of Hasbro for its property trading game and game equipment."

High quality cards can be burned for heat after society collapses.",

The Laugh & Learn Smart Stages Learn with Sis Walker is the perfect pal for your growing baby, offering exciting hands-on activities for little sitters and tons of encouraging phrases and support for those first little steps.

Little muscles get a big workout as sitting babies reach for and interact with the activities and then pull up to stand and walk behind the walker. Babies are introduced to cause and effect as they discover how to activate the music and phrases by pressing the buttons or pushing the walker along."

This edition comes with 4 favorite tokens: Little Scottie, Little Hazel, Toy Car, and the famous top hat worn by Mr. Monopoly. Players move their tokens around the board, buying the properties they love such as the zoo, and a video game arcade. It's fun for them to place a \"sold\" sign on their very own property. Parents often enjoy introducing their kids to counting and the simple math of the transactions. Single banknotes keep the transactions fast and easy. When a player goes bankrupt, the others count their cash and the player with the most cash wins the game. The Hasbro Gaming, Parker Brothers, and Monopoly names and logos, the distinctive design of the gameboard, the four corner squares, the Mr. Monopoly name and character, as well as each of the distinctive elements of the board and playing pieces are trademarks of Hasbro for its property trading game and game equipment."

See where the spinner lands and make a move. Left hand red, piece of cake! Right hand yellow, no problemo! Hilarity ensues as players twist, turn, tangle -- and struggle to keep their hands and feet glued to the mat. Right foot blue \u2026 uh oh, this is getting tough! Who can do it? Once a player topples over, or their knee or elbow hits the mat, they're out. The last player standing wins! For ages 6 and up, the Classic Twister game is a fun thing to do while staying at home, and it\u2019s a great outdoor game for kids to play with family and friends. Are you ready to be the next Twister game champ? Hasbro Gaming and all related trademarks and logos are trademarks of Hasbro, Inc.",

            ". Such a simple concept, with so much potential for hilarity. The game includes a plastic mat with red, blue, yellow, and green spots; a spinner; and instructions. To play (as if you didn\u0092t already know\u0085), two to four players face each other, with the plastic mat in the center. A referee spins the spinner, then calls out the body part and the color the arrow points to (\"Left foot, blue,\" \"Right hand, yellow\"). All players, at the same time, follow the directions, placing the appropriate body part on a vacant circle. Players become increasingly entangled, until someone (or everyone) finally topples, and is eliminated. The last person standing\u0097er, crouching\u0097wins. If this doesn\u0092t bring families and friends (and celebrities) closer together, we don\u0092t know what does! Out-and-out fun.",

It features 55+ surprises to unbox, 10+ hangout areas, and it fits L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. fashion dolls and L.O.L. Surprise! dolls. The front detaches to become a separate car with adjustable D.J. booth, working headlights and horn. The back opens up to 2 feet tall by 3 feet wide for the full glam life experience. Dolls can get the party going by sliding down the 2-story water slide, swimming in the light up pool, then getting ready for their star moment at the vanity. Then, dolls can strut their stuff on the fashion runway. Place dolls in the doll stand at the end of the runway, then turn the wheel on the side. Dolls spin all the way around in a runway twirl to show off their look. After the fashion show, they can chill out with a snack in the caf\u00e9 or the BBQ patio before heading up to sleep. The 4-in-1 Glamper includes bunk beds for L.O.L. Surprise! dolls and a full-size bed for L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. fashion dolls. Includes lights and sounds that really work! When you're done playing, the pool can easily be removed to clean and remove the water, then you can close up the 4-in-1 Glamper and store all the accessories inside, so it's ready to take on the go. Take all your B.B.s on a fabulous road trip with the L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. 4-in-1 Glamper."

            "Mother, Olive is calm and gentle. She loves cream puffs full of custard, because the custard is yellow like her! Cream puffs are her special snack and she doesn't like to share them, so she keeps them up high where the children can't see them and eats them when the children aren't looking. But the children always see the custard around her mouth and say \"Can we have some?\". Father, Egbert is a calm, gentle soul. He often forgets how tall he is and bumps his head on things. He likes old things and takes good care of them\u2014he has lots and lots of vintage tools. Baby Sister, Brie loves to look into the distance with the binoculars her father gave her. She loves to sit all the way up on her mother's head so that she can see even further. When her brother, who's a year older than her, takes photos, she puts them in a diary and writes about them. Baby Brother, Bran loves to take photos with the camera his father gave him. He wants to grow up big and tall like his father, so that he can see far off in the distance and take wonderful photos from up high."
