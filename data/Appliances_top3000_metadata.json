            "Maintaining proper humidity levels is integral to maintaining Healthy Air. This genuine AprilAire replacement water panel humidifier filter features a porous ceramic-type coating that absorbs water and maintains the proper level of hydration to support the evaporation process. Water is vaporized as air warmed by the furnace passes over the water panel humidifier filter carrying humidified air throughout the house through the air ducts. AprilAire has been there since the beginning by introducing the first whole-home humidifier in 1954. Since then, we've continued to focus on quality design, engineering, and manufacturing to deliver Healthy Humidity to every home. Healthy Humidity reduces the incidence and risk of respiratory infections from airborne viruses. It also helps remedy your dry skin, chronic sore throat, frequent nosebleeds, and static shock. Additionally, proper humidity levels protect your home's wood furnishings from cracking or splitting while lowering your energy bill. Keep your AprilAire Humidifier running at peak performance by replacing your water panel annually. The Model #35 Water Panel dimensions are 10\" W x 13\" H x 1.75\" D and illustrated instructions help you change your water panel quickly and efficiently."

For best results, replace your Samsung filter every 6 months. This refrigerator water filter is used in select Samsung French door and side-by-side refrigerators with filter access inside the refrigerator. While retaining beneficial fluoride, this NSF\u00ae Certified refrigerator water filter reduces cysts, chlorine taste and odor, particulates (Class I), lead and mercury. Replace your Samsung Refrigerator water filter every 6 months to ensure clean, safe drinking water. Samsung water filters are tested and certified by NSF\u00ae International, a not-for-profit, non-governmental organization dedicated to public health, safety and environmental protection. Reduction of Contaminants: Samsung water filters use only a high-grade carbon block which removes over 99% of the potentially harmful contaminants that may be present in your water, including: \u2022 Chlorine Taste & Odor: Chlorine is used widely to treat water but may add a particular taste and odor to the water \u2022 Heavy Metals & Chemicals: Lead, asbestos, benzene, mercury and carbofuran; these common industrial contaminants with high toxicities can infiltrate the water source and be potentially harmful to your health \u2022 Microbial Cysts: Parasites such as cryptosporidium are commonly found in lakes and rivers. They have a high resistance over disinfectants such as chlorine and thus may be present even in treated water."

            "Maintaining proper humidity levels is integral to maintaining Healthy Air. This genuine AprilAire replacement water panel humidifier filter features a porous ceramic-type coating that absorbs water and maintains the proper level of hydration to support the evaporation process. Water is vaporized as air warmed by the furnace passes over the water panel humidifier filter carrying humidified air throughout the house through the air ducts. AprilAire has been there since the beginning by introducing the first whole-home humidifier in 1954. Since then, we've continued to focus on quality design, engineering, and manufacturing to deliver Healthy Humidity to every home. Healthy Humidity reduces the incidence and risk of respiratory infections from airborne viruses. It also helps remedy your dry skin, chronic sore throat, frequent nosebleeds, and static shock. Additionally, proper humidity levels protect your home's wood furnishings from cracking or splitting while lowering your energy bill. Keep your AprilAire Humidifier running at peak performance by replacing your water panel annually. The Model #10 Water Panel dimensions are 9.5\" W x 9.75\" H x 1.75\" D and illustrated instructions help you change your water panel quickly and efficiently."

            "More convenient and economic! Perma-Brew 3 Year Re-useable Coffee Filters offer solutions to the world's most common coffee-related problems. Always ready to use: No more running out of filters! Ecologically sound: No more daily filter disposal! Easy to fill: No more trying to separate a single filter from a stack of paper filters! The filters' rigid shape makes them easier to fill with coffee and easier to insert in the coffeemaker than paper filters. Fits coffeemakers using 3 \u00bd\u201d disk filters or wraparound filters including 7 to 14 cup electric percolators and stovetop percolators, and 8, 10 and 12 cup Norelco original Dial-A-Brew models. They feature micro-fine filter openings which retain coffee sediment while flavor and aromatic components pass through for optimum extraction and \"fresh brewed\" taste. Dishwasher safe and will fit most coffeemakers that use disk or wrap-around percolator \ufb01lters, including electric and stovetop percolators. Good for the environment and good for your wallet!"

            "Why buy the Recycle A Cup\u00ae Cutter? Millions of people across the United States use pod-based coffee brewing systems to create their morning cup of jo. While these single cup coffee pod machines are undoubtedly convenient, their single-use nature generates a significant amount of waste. With this in mind, you may wonder, \u201cAre K-Pods\u00ae recyclable?\u201d Unfortunately, most single-serve coffee cups aren\u2019t recyclable in their original state. This means that many end up in landfills, where they will sit for hundreds of years \u2013 or worse, be blown into nearby waterways where they could affect wildlife. Coffee pods are great, but they can produce a bunch of waste! The coffee pods can only be recycled if the plastic, aluminum, paper and coffee components are separated and sorted into the correct categories for recycling or composting. The Recycle A Cup\u00ae works with the majority of coffee pod brands like Keurig and allows you to separate the pod into the components for recycling and composting. The Recycle A Cup cutter comes in a Single Pack containing two coffee pod recycling tools, a Double Pack containing four cutters, and a Triple Pack containing six cutters. It\u2019s as easy as making your coffee, separating the pod, then recycling the coffee pod."

            "The Best Quality Filter for Keurig You Can Buy! We spent almost a year checking out factories before choosing one which could provide the high quality and service we (and you) demand. There are cheaper suppliers we could buy from, but none that meet our high standards. After our experience of years of production and over 200,000 sold, we have made a good product even better. Of course, that includes 100% BPA-free plastic, food-grade stainless steel, and 100% dishwasher safe! ! Backed by the Best Guarantee! Millions of these filters have been sold, and our product reviews and customer feedback are tops. And they are backed by our 100% No-Hassle Money Back Guarantee. If you have a problem, contact us. If we can\u2019t fix the problem we\u2019ll replace the filters or refund your money. (If you call Amazon customer service they will tell you that the product is not returnable. That\u2019s Amazon\u2019s policy, NOT ours.) Just click \u201cAsk Seller\u201d on your order page. Great Design! No hacks! The easiest refillable pod to use and clean! Unlike some other brands, ValueCafe refillable pods do not need any hacks, tips, or brewer modifications or add-ons to use.

Insert ValueCafe pods just as you would an expensive pre-filled pod!"

(This is VERY common with GE and several other major brand refrigerators) To be 100% sure that is the issue, insert a 8\u201d- 12\u201d zip tie or weed whacker line into the water dispenser tube. If it goes all the way in, you do not have a frozen line. If it does not insert fully, you DO have a frozen water line....and we can help!!",

No cleaning is required and the wicks are disposable. The superior performance promised of Vornado's evaporative humidifiers is realized only when genuine Vornado wicks are used and replaced at the recommended intervals. While other brands may fit our units, these wicks do not carry the same quality and life as our own and can diminish the humidifier\u2019s performance. Vornado wicks are developed from the highest quality materials that work to absorb the maximum amount of water while filtering the circulating air.",

            "Control the flow of air through your home or RV with our Magnetic Vent Covers. These 3 flexible magnetic sheets install quickly and securely to metal sidewall and floor vents. Sized to fit standard vents, at 5\u201d by 12\u201d, and may be trimmed down with scissors for a more custom fit. By closing off the vents in one area, you redirect the air flow to needed areas. These white covers may be painted or papered to match your decor. Note: Do not cover too many registers at once. Do not use on return air registers. These vent covers do not have adequate strength to stay adhered to ceiling vents and are not intended for that use. Deflecto was founded on innovative, problem solving products. For over a half century, we have built a tradition of discovering and meeting needs with invention and dependable manufacturing. Today, Deflecto is the world\u2019s largest chair mat, bicycle reflector and dryer venting manufacturer and a global leader in sign and literature holders, office workspace accessories and other air distribution products."

Instead of removing all impurities, it only filters out those which negatively impact health, leaving behind healthy minerals such as fluoride.",
            "From the Manufacturer",
            "Clean, great tasting water and ice is what you get when you purchase a LG LT500P 500-gallon capacity water filter for your LG or Kenmore brand refrigerator. Purchasing this filter means you are receiving the expertise of a world leader in liquid filtration that has been around for more than 90 years. You can be assured of getting high quality water for your home or your business that is free of harmful contaminants such as chlorine, dirt, rust and other particles, as well as unpleasant odors and tastes. The materials used in making the LG LT500P water filter are top quality materials ensuring that the product lasts longer while filtering away most of the impurities. This water filter will also prolong the life of your refrigerator. It was designed to lessen the sediment deposits in your refrigerators ice machine. The filtration process handled by the water filter involves the passing of the water from the exterior surfaces until it goes into the middle of the cartridge. With every filtering layer that the water goes through, the pores of the filters become smaller, so as to get rid of even the most minute particles or impurities in water. It does not remove minerals which may be beneficial to health such as fluoride. The interval of the changing of these filters is dependent on the quality of your water as well as on the water consumption of your entire household. It replaces part number 5231JA2002A for model 5231JA2002A-S. The LT500P should be replaced every six months and requires no tools for installation and replaces the water filter in a variety of LG and Kenmore refrigerators. They are a world leader in the design, manufacture, and marketing of filtration products for the separation, clarification, and purification of fluids and gasses. Its proprietary products are widely used throughout the global healthcare, industrial, and water markets."

            "Opal Nugget Ice, is The Good Ice! Our nugget ice is chewable, crunchy, and airy in texture: because it\ufffds made from compacted ice flakes! Our beautifully designed countertop nugget ice maker is developed to avoid ice clumps and produces one pound of fresh ice per hour and has a large-capacity bin that holds up to 3lbs of crunchable nugget ice - that's 24 pounds of ice per day. Begin enjoying your first batch of ice in 20 minutes or less with the rapid production of this countertop ice maker. You'll always have fresh ice on hand thanks to a smart, automatic ice maker that refills when your ice is running low. Troubleshooting: (1) Unit alerts to add water when reservoir is already full of water (switching blue light ring) - *Inadequate water flow - Follow descale procedure manual page 9 of Use of Care *Air in water lines - Clearing trapped air requires manual priming of the unit. Remove white water filter or metal particulate filter. In a rapid plunger like movement, press finger at reservoir outlet 4 times to force water into lines (2) Low quantity ice or unit continues to enter defrost (slowly falling white light ring) - *Inadequate Cooling - With unit off, using a vacuum, clean the vent on left side of the unit to remove dust/debris *Improper Spacing around unit - Ensure unit has a minimum of 3 inches of clearance around the side and back walls of the ice maker for proper air circulation (3) Hardwater stains in reservoir/back wall/ice bin - *Descale procedure manual page 9 of Use and Care."

By contrast, vinegar leaves behind the most residue. This is why your next brew tastes so weird after a vinegar cleaning (which is less effective than commercial descalers in the first place).",

Compare: You get one cleaning from one full 14oz. bottle of \"their\" descalers, and TWO complete cleanings from only 8 oz of K&J's descaling solution. AND, if you disagree with the claims made about the solution after using it, then you get 100% of your money back, no questions asked. We are that confident that you will love this newer, safer product. Honestly, it's a no-brainer and we are looking forward to helping you",

Permenant filter Pads can be used time and time again and refilled with your favourite blend, not only cutting down on waste but saving yourself a few pennies too! simple to refill and insert/remove from the machine, the permenant filters possess 3 integrated tabs that allow them to be easily opened and filled with your desired variety and strength of coffee or tea (finely ground coffee will tend to give a stronger flavour) and to be cleaned after use. Compatible with the majority of the Philippe Senseo coffee machine range, including Senseo Quadrante, Viva Cafe, new generation, aluminium, Senseo II, latte or cappuccino select and other similar models, the Pads feature an ultra-fine filter mesh to achieve the perfect Cafe crema foam and same quality coffee texture and taste that you\u2019re used to. With an impressive service life, the permanent filter proves to be exactly that, a permanent addition to your machine, with little need for replacement for use as often as is desired. Place the pod with the container for 2 pods in the machine. With pod holders for 1 pod, this will unfortunately not work.

No clamps, tools or tape are needed. Some dryers require the included gasket for a proper fit. The Hooker-Upper protectors are designed to prevent the duct from being smashed behind the dryer, which helps prevent unsafe dryer operation and longer dryer times. Deflecto was founded on innovative, problem solving products. For over a half century, we have built a tradition of discovering and meeting needs with invention and dependable manufacturing. Today, Deflecto is the world\u2019s largest chair mat, bicycle reflector and dryer venting manufacturer and a global leader in sign and literature holders, office workspace accessories and other air distribution products.",

The filtration system is composed of a carbon cylinder derived from organic coconut shell compounds. It is riddled with millions of micro-pores that keep hydrophobic particles like lead, zinc, asbestos, hydrogen sulfide, or chlorine out of your drinking water. It allows beneficial hydrophilic particles, those sometimes found in water like Calcium or Sodium, into your glass. Between the two of these filters, you can rest assured that your family will enjoy improved health for up to a year."
